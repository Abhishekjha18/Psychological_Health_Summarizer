<PrimaryTopic: anxiety> <SecondaryTopic: hygiene-dog> <GlobalEmotion: 0.00>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel my stats were much higher than the end. I guess that was what we talked about the
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Did that change by yesterday?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. you're doing well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today we planned, right. Okay. this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): right. the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. did you write the story?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would say a 70.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. you have that for homework. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): let me now your stress level
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 90
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you're doing great, keep going.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I keep going. I walk the dog, come back home, and I leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. I can't stop thinking about washing. I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep. The next morning I wake up, and I already feel sick. I know I'm sick. I'm shivering and I'm, I feel I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated. I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick. And I feel really, really sick.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, great job. What's your level now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 80. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All right. keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you stay with that image as much as you can. you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. you go toward the leash, and it makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel it's running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is powerful, strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 80
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay, you take it back and you do it again. Okay. Good job.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, so, I'm home. The dog starts barking

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, yeah.

Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): Yeah, I think that'll be good because then also in the morning, I'll remember it's the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): There are a lot of places we're going to go. As we talk about CBT and how it relates to what you're going through. I don't want to put too much on you at one time. I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd that to be one of the, you know, if you're with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. be two things for this week. that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, feeling worried. they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, a thought like, oh, they're not doing well. don't judge the thought. write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. What should I do with it? Should I write it on a sticky note and get rid of it? Should I keep it in a journal or?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Good question. I would say keep in touch. journal, okay, and bring it in.

Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I mean, I think it was really helpful. I had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, write it down and everything. I can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I think that would be a great start. And we'll set up a time for down here for another point for next week. We'll get that all situated. But I want to Close by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session. Okay. I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've worked a lot to help other people. I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well. And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I hope that you'll be able to overcome what's going on now.

And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=vc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I think youreally need to quit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, alcohol is prevalent in our society and it's around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel I should get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. That's really important.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, I, I I don't see the problem in it now. And maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic event experience. But,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do you want to wait for that to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): You're right. I don't want I don't want to be too far gone. Before it's too late. I I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much are affected anybody close to me that much. I guess it's something that I feel I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you that you can get control here and stop drinking.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into and life of possibly being sober and experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Sounds good.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, Chris, I wanted to talk to, you know, you're one of our star athletes and really value you as a team player. As athletic director, one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend, I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. Oh, could I can find something new. That doesn't bother me lately. Well, prior to that party, as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend's house.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Ahmm
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Alright.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I, that's when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don't know, It was fun, at least in that moment. I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I'll pick you up by 12. Our surprise is told us when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I'll, I'll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Uhh
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): later, she promised that she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. we go out Have fun I've, I've been having, and I was drinking. And then it's time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon as I couldn't delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I looked at the floor, and I feel terrible. Because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): right. I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Ahhh hmmm.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Really, I kind of sit in class my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I'm caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It has really changed your focus. What do you about drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I don't know it. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I'm doing sports, but like, a social environment, I tend to keep to myself. Because I'm very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. And it's just.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, it helps you kind of loosen up feel more relaxed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds you're noticing quite a few not good things about alcohol though. Mom got mad at you. You're having decreased focus, you're kind of not doing in school, maybe any other things ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): different group friends of group girlfriends, the different people that I'm hanging out. Not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene. that that's also changed.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): a little bit because not all of them are into that. like, I'm in one group of friends and I will talk to another person within another group of friends and they happen to invite me to that first party.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): hmm.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): since then, I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them. But I could also see that on living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying and it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, I should I should stop. I mean, like, I'm not, not unrealistic.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I understand that. situations this will happen. It's up to me not to take it far where I can't remember the night before. If I'm puking, all I remember is a toilet.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): That's, that's not worth it either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little or, as it may seem to the other people to me that it's a big thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Your mom is really important to you ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): of course,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): how confident are you that you could change your drinking or even cut down or quit?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm pretty confident
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): especially on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all and 10 is completely what number ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): probably an eight or nine I'm I can't be in time because nothing's attend my field. There's too many factors but I feel I'm determined to
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Because I don't know I feel determined to to make sure this happens because I don't how I felt after I betrayed my mother. I don't remembering that the feeling of vomiting.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): It's not a pleasant experience. It's not something that I wish to enjoy. like, even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens. all the fun that I have, then prior to that, it's not worth it's not worth drinking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right? What do you think's a realistic goal for you then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): To make sure I have my studies? Well, first, try to get back my trust with my mother.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0):

Then if I have time for leisure time, I'll go party with my friends and be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do. One cup is not gonna do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that I prefer make sure
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your goals to not drink at all, or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very moment.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All right, Chris, I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend, and from what I hear while you were there, and you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, yeah, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school one, too. You know, I drink too. I get it.

It's bad for my body is bad for for, for for being on the team for being an athlete. it hinders my performance. I don't know, I feel that my friends pressured me. I don't know if I should, like, go with different friend groups. Maybe I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know. Like, being in a sports team. You feel very, you have to, like, be unified with the group.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, well, you're one of the leaders.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be expected To lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's social, social custom in our society,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe you can start leading as a non drinker then
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having the stick up my blood. You know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're a star player who's gonna pick on you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, it's one. I'm one person.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Well, supermom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): Yeah. the issue again, is, I can't be hearing reports about your drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, I said, I get it. You know, I understand I know what it's I get that you want to have fun, your teenage years. I get that. But you know, you are start player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Okay. Well, I'll dedicate the time not to party and like, no, not not not party, but you get involved with alcohol to that extent. And, have it publicized on the internet.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What do you mean?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet? Like, I will avoid situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet others can see.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right, yeah, I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team, okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'll stop.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, you promise?

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I always say to myself that I'll try to drink less but at this point, it's kind of what have I got to lose? You know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You're drinking more ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, yeah, yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a lot more ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): cuz now you don't have a job
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): hmmm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): are you feeling good about the drinking ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): At this point, it's kind of who cares? what difference does it really make, you know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sure in different tours.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When you're drinking does it still feel good?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Nothing really feels good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): gets back to normal.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, pretty much
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When was the last time you drank ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this morning
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How much?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): A lot, I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't recall.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. to get through the day. yeah, I mean, I drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. I'll drink some then. You know, and to function, I don't know how much I don't know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what your fuel is those towards you're drinking more.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is now ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'm pretty indifferent. I said, I mean, I don't. I don't. At this point. It's what does it matter everything else has, I dont know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I guess I don't know why I should keep suffering making myself suffer.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the drinking tastes was suffering.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): feeling bad about the drinking ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How would you to feel bad ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): I would to not, I would to be happy. I would to not drink I would to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And I'm supposed to keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you no longer understand the point of life ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this doesn't make any sense to me. why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, what do you see as your options now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I don't know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, in the last three or four days.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): sitting at home drinking hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's funny like, I don't even there is nothing
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now I know you're working on a few things you're working on find another job. You've been doing that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house I'm biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have stopped looking for a job.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): hmmm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And when are you losing your house?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems it will be soon.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What's your plan for when that happens?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I don't have one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You don't have one ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): No, no.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): before we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I've decided I'm not gonna worry about it anymore. I can't I can't do it anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): can't worry anymore ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): Yeah. my life is full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): There is no alternative.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what do you do?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You don't know ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yes. Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Like, markedly so.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. Like, I feel things have taken a turn.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can you tell me about that turn?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I don't know. I feel you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Got in done order for what?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): if I died,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): if you die if you die Nothing would have to be taken care of. I mean, like,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Would your family miss you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I don't really care.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Even still, you think they would miss you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Maybe I mean, in their own way. They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently. Yeah, but that's not my responsibility.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What's your responsibility now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Nothing. Nothing. I mean,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): no one would correct me if I'm wrong. No one would care if you die.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I mean, they probably care a little bit. Do I care if they care? No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you care a little, but you're not concerned with that. And you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you've lost a job. And now soon, your house you have anything else that you care about? Any goals ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I used to
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how about now ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What happened to your goals?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): I drank them. I lost my job. I lost my house. But you know, I was thinking maybe I could find myself a new job but at this point I'm far gone my life is ruined I don't know how you could expect me to come back from this I don't know how you can expect me to live a life how to pick this up and make something of it
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): how to redeem yourself.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Mm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you can't see what to do that now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean come on. Cuz cuz all things that happened to overwhelmed you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I mean, happened to me did to myself. It's at this point. It's I've lost much have what I worked for. And I don't have one scrap of dignity or anything at all. I don't have anything.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't have anything you don't have any worth. worthless. That's how you're feeling ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, alone. worthless. Yeah, nothing. There's nothing redeemable. There's nothing I can build upon.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): and have you been thinking about ending your life? Are you hesitant to tell me that ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): why is that ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): I guess a lot of reasons. I know that we have worked together and I don't want you to feel you failed. I really don't want you to try to do anything because I feel nothing that you have tried has worked. You know, I'm a hopeless case.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): hmmm
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): And I feel at this point, it shouldn't even be your responsibility to try because it's not fair to you anymore. And I don't know. I Oh,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): you're planning on ending your life ? ideal plan in place ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can you tell me about the plan?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I don't really want to talk about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): But you have a plan. You don't want me to interfere in your plan?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): No, no, obviously not.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): But you're aware that I'm going to try to interfere with your plan.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I get I guess so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You mentioned earlier that you I mean, it sounds you're saying is you've hit rock bottom and rock bottom can't be tolerated. And your family would care if they lost you, but you're indifferent to that. Right? I would care if you die. All right, I'm gonna do everything I can to prevent that. It's hard to see when you have thoughts or worthlessness. It's hard to see stress. But I see somebody with strengths. I see a young lady that over the last few months has told me all kinds of strengths, all kinds of situations where you've been resilient.You recall those conversations ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): But that's not in the forefront of your mind now. You're strange, but they're still there. Do you have an intent to commit suicide?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you don't want me to stop here?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm going to stop you. Right? I want to, I'm obligated to. And it's really the best thing to be done is to prevent it. I know you feel this way now, and I know I can't fully understand that. But I'm fairly sure that you won't feel this way. A week or two from now. feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hitting rock bottom, they cycle all feelings. Right? You've had ups and downs before. Remember ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I see some of the long and productive life. suicides not it's not the answer. I know it seems the only option now. I get that. But there's still some other options. Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know you probably don't wanna hear about other options. I think what we should do today is get you over as an impatient Alright? And go pi keep you for 5-10 days and kind of work on getting your mood stable. My guess is when you come out, you'll feel differently on this subject. You'll feel a little better. Maybe feel a little better place we can continue. And we will. I'll see you will schedule associate that on the day or the day after you come out. Right. Preferably on the same day. Does that make sense to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Are you disappointed? I'm trying to save your life.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Do you understand why I'm doing it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. I'm gonna walk you over 20 other counselors. I gotta make some phone calls. We'll get you over there. Okay. All right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's all fairly recent.

I started to step a bit later and take on a bit more work. my stress levels sort of start to increase over a while. I was drinking a lot more coffee took few caffeine tablets and energy drinks. A few people were because some of the environment at the time was a lot of people were pushing themselves that they wouldn't normally do and some people were taking Ritalin.

And yeah, I thought to grow even further. I mentioned I was I was taking Ritalin to block coffee and as soon as our exams had stopped, I substance abuse of took a bit more of a hold. And yeah, I sort of grew into this person who I thought was him was the guy that everyone wanted to be around and to see and I made sure that I was everywhere that could be seen I was.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and what kind of things did you notice? Did you notice any changes from having less and less sleep in your body maybe the way you were thinking.

He said you're going out a lot you convinced your friend to do this app. Was there anything else that you did that maybe you wouldn't normally do that you think might have been assigned to you that your meat was much higher than you'd it to be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There was I hide a lot of savings. That my my parents had built up for me, which I probabiliy don't really exist anymore either through the money invested, and through drugs, clothes. I had a girlfriend at the time but because it was because I was the main character, and in a sense, it always was only the only person that matters and sort of those around me especially, still didn't really have as much importance. on nights out, I wouldn't. She wouldn't be in my mind and that would be Other women.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how do you feel about that now looking back on it ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think it's, it's those moments where it's not me. It's those those closest to you and those around you that have to suffer the more than anyone else that brings a lot of the shame

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I think it was after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her. I'm going to get in trouble. I'm going to go cut.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what were you thinking at that point?

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): on my leg.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): three
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band aid but whatever.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But it wasn't deep that you needed something more?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger?

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): That felt good. I feel better. And I'm gonna have to talk to Michelle about this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): The Feeling better? Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, it did
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's what happened afterwards ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): Well, I kind of forgot about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): But then I started thinking about it again, before bad, and feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds you weren't feeling good about it then as you were in the afternoon.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): No. That always seems to happen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I guess so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I've been doing pretty good
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have you've been working really hard. I'm wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): Yeah, maybe. I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, with the cutting it sounds the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): Yeah, cuz she's stupid.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it sounds you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. That's right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): It's not going to bring it down all the way to a three, though. I'll tell you that much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It might not. But it'll bring it down a little bit. Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe there'll be things will feel good about later. You won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the first thing is that pencil, it sounds it's comforting to have it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It also sounds it's tempting, What do you think about that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I mean, Only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things. When you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I am.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds that pencils standing in your way.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, maybe.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time, choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you can't cut with.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, maybe only, only if it's can be a really cool pencil
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you. That'll make it easier to try the two things.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, what do you think our first thing should be? What do you think you can try? You heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry. What can you do in that moment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Oh, what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't want to hear I put my headphones on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you have your headphones with you at school?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, they they they they let me keep them on in school.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that something you'd be willing to try next time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I think so. there's a there's a few songs that usually helped me I think so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that sounds a good one to try. we have headphones, we need to come up with One more. What do you think you'd to try?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Well, I really my teacher, Mrs. Xion. she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk. And her rooms kind of down the hallway from my locker than the same hallway. I guess I could talk to her.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That sounds a good option. That's our goal is to keep pushing, cutting further down the list, and keep adding things that you're going to try first. And you're that the first thing you try, it might not bring you all the way down to a two or three, but it might bring you down a little bit. And each thing you try might bring you down a little bit more. you have to be willing to try a few things. Can you do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can, but I really want a cooler pencil though, like, a cooler pencil, I don't know, maybe, maybe we could go look for a pencil together.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think that's a good idea.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, I'd that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Thank you for answering all my questions on this. You did a great job with this chain and I know it wasn't easy.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. You're welcome.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Let's go look for a pencil.
Summary: The patient has been angry that another girl had been talking about their boyfriend Tim near their locker the other day. They were angry at a score of 9 out of 10. The patient decided to go to the gym behind the bleachers to cut themselves, by using their favorite pencil with metal head. They cut on their leg three times. The patient scored their anger 3 out of 10 after the cut. The patient felt guilty for cutting themselves. The therapist suggests to think of alternatives, and asks to buy a new favorite pencil and get rid of metal head pencil. They discuss another idea to put on headphones if they wish to avoid to hear things that make them angry. The patient suggested that they will talk to Mrs. Xion who seems to be kind. The therapist assures these ideas if tried will slowly help and accompanies the patient to buy a new pencil.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): How things been going since the last time we met?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): it's about the same. I'm still feeling pretty down. I mean, I feel really stuck and not happy and I don't know why.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, there's a few things going on there. You said you feeling stuck? Not happy. And some sound a little confused as to what's going on what's causing it. You have any suspicions about what might be causing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I've been feeling really isolated lately. You know, because I'm a stay at home mom. It's hard. There's not a lot of people. You know, at my fingertips to spend my time with, you know, obviously my family but, um, I guess, you know, I kind of I had some friends in the neighborhood, but like, our friendships kind of fizzled out. And I ever since then it's like, I don't really feel doing much. I kind of feel what's the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff. You know, I used to, you know, shop for the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning and I still do that stuff. But a lot of times, you know, I let it slide. Sometimes I won't make dinner or whatever. And when I do do it, I feel I'm forcing myself to do it. The passion is gone.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how long have you been? You say housewife, right? How long, you've been the housewife?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): For a long time, I have two boys. They're eight and 10 and I've been staying home since my first one was born. 10 years and you know, it's it's been really rewarding for me I'm not really interested in going back to work or anything that. Because I know people always say you're, you know, you're feeling unfulfilled, you should go back to work, but it's not it. You know, I've felt happy with it for long. I don't think that it's being home. I think it's some thing inside of me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): something's changed. for a long time, you were satisfied in housewife, you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life. And somewhere along the line, something changed in you. And now you're not happy with it. what it represents in terms of activities caring for your children and shopping? No, that's what changed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, exactly. Well, I guess, you know, my youngest is eight. he's only been in school for a couple of years. I guess like, it's not super recent, but recently he, I finally have no children in the home. it's more, it's more time to myself. And I kind of fill that gap a little bit with other things. I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while. And I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood that kind of like, fill that time. But now that stuff, it's not really happening anymore. now I kind of feel it's not it's not boredom, you know, it's not I don't have enough to do. It's like, I don't want to do anything. But then at the same time, I feel frustrated because there's nothing to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you're, you're frustrated with your situation, maybe with yourself a little bit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I think a lot more with myself because I know That I would feel better if I, you know, maybe found more friends or found something to do with my time, but I don't want to at the same time, I'm frustrated with myself because I know I kind of know what would help but then I don't really have the the volition to do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You're not motivated?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Yeah,I'm not motivated.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning? Has anyone else noticed that you're down?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, obviously, my husband has noticed because he has to get the boys ready in the morning. He's really supportive. I know he can tell that I'm not feeling the same. But you know, he works. And then he has to come home and pick up my slack. he's getting frustrated, which I understand. And, you know, my mom has said to me that, you know, she thinks I'm not doing as much and it kind of hurts. It feels everybody's trying to tell me I'm lazy and then I'm not doing enough and it's always that feeling, you know, nobody really understands how much work that goes into being a mother, but then at the same time now that I'm doing less and less, I feel they're all right. You know, I am lazy. I'm not doing anything
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): they used the word lazy.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): No, no, not that I can remember. I, you know, I think my mom said, like, you're not doing as much as you used to and I kind of took offense to that, even though it's kind of true. It's like, I don't know. It hurt.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that was painful for you. What about what your husband said?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): You know, I think at first we didn't really acknowledge it. It was like, you know, I took a break here. He picked up the slack and it was fine, but now that it's been and more he's kind of getting frustrated and, you know, he's been asking me about how I feel and why I'm not doing as much but at the same time, like, even though he knows that I'm not motivated, it's still frustrating because I, it's my responsibility. I think he's, you know, he's been saying, like, I need you to do more around the house pretty much is what he said, I need you to do more.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What was your response to that? When I said, I need you to more?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I started crying because I know he's and that's what I tell myself every day, I need to do more, but I don't have the motivation to do it. And I'm frustrated with myself. And, you know, I know that he needs that from me and I don't know why I'm not motivated to do it.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And as little as a few years ago, you didn't feel it this way at all?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. Yeah, I think, you know, I've been feeling this way more in the past, six months or something that, I, it was hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in the natural way that it is hard. But this is something else this is more consuming. It's, you know, the difficulty of him going away to school, almost was motivating, it was hard, but at the same time, it was freeing because I had other opportunities to do stuff. This is stunting.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, I'm gonna shift gears a little bit. Can you tell me about your well, a recent day? it's kind of typical what you're telling me now meaning not motivated down?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Sure. Onn Wednesday, I was having a really hard time getting out of bed. my husband got the kids ready in the morning and I felt really bad about that. I stayed in bed for a couple more hours, probably until 1030. And I got up you know, I'm made myself something to eat. And then I thought, you know, I should probably go to the store because we're almost out of milk. And, you know, and I think the boys need shampoo, but I just, I sat down and I sat there and I think I sat for I don't even know how long the boys came home from school. It was like, you know, 330 and I hadn't even gotten up. And then I said, Okay, the boys are home. I should probably get started on dinner soon, because my husband will be home soon. And I found I found something in the fridge to make and I made dinner and you know, after that everybody, you know, sat down, we watch TV and I sat there until it was time to go to bed.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): This is you said this was recently right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Ummhuhh
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What would the ideal day of look take that same day and do you wish you could have done?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I wish that I would wake up and you know, I would want to wake up when it was time for the kids to get ready to school to go to school. You know, I could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed, I could pay for lunches and get the boys dressed and you know, check they needed any permission slip sign, that kind of thing. Send them out the door and then I would see if we needed anything from the store. I probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house. I used to have a list of chores that I would do different things on different days and different days of the month and stuff. bedding would get washed one day in the week and that kind of thing. I would probably follow that list. Nowadays I just, you know if it gets done, it gets done and usually my husband helps me with some of the stuff and you know, I would do the bathrooms one day a week that probably gets done once a month now. But um, I would do that do the cleaning. If we if I needed to go to the story we do that. I get ready for the boys to come home I'd probably make them a snack and and figure out what was going to be for dinner, I would go ahead and do that. And then probably, you know, sometimes we we would watch TV after my husband got home after dinner or I would figure out something for us to do, we could play a board game or or watch a movie as a family or something that. And that would be after the kids did their homework and everything that. And then after we spent some time together, I put them in a bed.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, it's a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior and where you want to be. let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day you would mention that when it was time to get up. Right? You did. you were awake and aware of it, but you went back to sleep. And, of course, your husband got up and he took care of things.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How did you feel alone Not to happen, because clearly that's not what you want to happen. How did you feel about oversleeping?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I like, you know, the alarm goes off, and I know it's time to get up and my husband's getting out of bed and I look at the clock and I think, what's the point and, you know, it's this instant feeling of I can't even describe it pointlessness of getting up. And so, I go back to sleep, but I feel worse for doing it. You know, like, it's a catch 22 like, I don't want to wake up, I don't want to, but then when I go back to sleep, I feel bad. I feel guilty.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, I'm not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought, which was, if I'm not mistaken, you said what's the point, can you expand on that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): It it's like, you know, when I'm sleeping, I don't realize how sad I am. And I don't realize how hard it is to function. When I'm sleeping. I'm not aware of that as soon as I wake up I am. And I have this feeling of like, what's the point of getting up and experiencing these feelings when I could go back to sleep and not have to
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What's the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. But then, when you when you do get up, you feel sad and guilty about having overslept.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): really, functionally, what you're doing is you're delaying experiencing the pain.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And then in terms of how it affects your relationships and your family, you're not getting your kids off to school. Your husband's getting real frustrated.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And all you've really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep. And you know, presumably without without pain because you're sleeping, but you're not really escaping it. Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, it was easy. I would like, you know, I would wake up and, and I would be like, Okay, it's time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go. I mean, you know, sometimes if, if, if I was a little bit tired, it would be a little bit harder. You know, it's not, you know, as a stay at home mom, I usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kids are older and everything, it's not usually too hard to get up and I would, I would, you know, it would be another good day, you know, I would be glad to get up and take care of the things that I needed to take care of and I felt accomplished.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe what's going on here? Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case, I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. behavior that's useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn't match. Right. sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems. If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right? Because that's why you're over sleeping, as you're sleeping longer to avoid that. But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed. maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate. Because functionally speaking, you're completing the tasks that you want. What's tough about that, in the moment, it's easy for me to say this now. But in the moment, for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you're going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later. in that moment, it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean, it sounds you want to get up and
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): yeah, I mean, I want everything to be normal again. And I guess I never really thought of it that. Like, I thought, Well, if I'm waking up at the time, and I'm feeling bad then like, I said, What's the point, but I guess it makes sense. Like, even if I don't feel doing it, maybe it'll make me feel better if I do do it, even if it's hard, because nothing is really harder than when I'm already going through.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, it seems you're, you're more or less making things worse, right? In an effort to avoid the pain that you're going to suffer anyway. You're making the pain worse, and delaying it a little bit, right. What what thought and we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless. Right, and I'm going to expand on my thought a little and say that, you know that thoughts really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer. That's a version of the thought.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Does that make sense? And also, I guess I thought that, no, it wouldn't really be that beneficial to get up.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. minimizing the benefit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's a couple of things going on, right? I can avoid the pain by slipping in. And there's really no point to getting out because I won't do any good anyway.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What adaptive response is that self talk, we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when you're, you know, whatever time you get up in the morning, when you're thinking about this, that thought comes in that it doesn't really matter if I get up anyway.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I guess I could tell myself I can do this. Instead of, you know, when I say to myself, what's the point instead I can say, I can do this? I can get out of it. It'll be okay. I can. I'm strong enough, even though it's hard to push through the pain and get up now, even though I don't want to, I can say I can do this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. that would be adaptive response. I'm strong enough. I can get through this, but it will be difficult. Right? How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school. The automatic thought now is telling you that's not valuable. But I think that you believe it is valuable.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, I know it's valuable. I guess what my frustration is, is that I know it's valuable and it used to give me an emotional payoff of like, pride and, and satisfaction and now I'm not getting that anymore. I guess I need to realize that even though I'm not getting it now. If I keep trying, maybe it will happen again, because it did happen before,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back. If you do get up, then if you guess that's true, right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): never get the satisfaction of sending my kids off to school by never send my kids off to school,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): I never thought about it that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That kind of makes sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem not a practical move. Logically, you know, that has a better chance of paying off for you and I think that with with these type of, what you're going through is probably depression. now what I to talk to you further, to make sure that's what's going on seems you're depressed, and sometimes with depression, you have to get one thing going your way each day. Right? So, I'm not saying necessarily tomorrow, you have to get up one time, and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right? You don't have to build Rome in a day here. Right? It's, it's more like, Can I do this one thing? Okay, I proved to myself, what I'm saying, which is I'm strong enough to get up. See the kids often have that one victory for tomorrow. and build on that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And part of that's going to be playing those adaptive responses back, thinking of those thoughts. Whether it's thinking them, you know, in your mind or thinking them and saying, sometimes it's helpful to say them out loud,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Not letting the negative thoughts take over because that's what I'm thinking like, okay, I can get the kids off to school, but after that, I'm going to start thinking You know, what's the point again? Like, what? Why don't I sit down, there's no point. if I can keep reminding myself that I have to try, and that I did accomplish something, and then, you know, even though it's hard, and I know that those thoughts are going to come back, and then I'm going to feel bad. If I don't do anything, I'm not going to feel any better.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have a good handle on the adaptive responses sounds right. And you know what you have to say after but you know, what you want to do. I'll see again in a week, and there'll be five days in there between now and my see again, we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not, right. I want you to give that a tryto adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior. Now it's important to keep in mind that we have five days between now I want to see you again in five business days, right? school days, and you may not succeed every day. And that's okay. Right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): hmmm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sometimes the setbacks you could, you could get up early two days in a row and then it goes up back up third day, don't let that will wash away those successes. It's a day by day fight, try not to think of it in terms of the week, I want you to try to think of it in terms of what I have to do today. Not worrying about the future, and not worrying about should done in the past.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): The only moment we really can live in is now. try to stay in present the moment recite those adaptive responses, and try to push for that that one victory. Okay, can you try that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah, I think I can try that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. work on that and To continue with the homework, that maybe the CBT homework haven't given you and I'll see you next week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Hi, Gabriela, I understand that you're here today because you've been experiencing some low mood.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I then recently I've been feeling down a lot. And I can't really snap out of it. sometimes if it's happened before, I can like, get myself back on track. But recently, I've found it really difficult to do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it sounds you've been experiencing some low mood and you're kind of struggling to get going a bit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of you've been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently, you found that harder. Okay, I understand that you you first went to your GP he referred you here about two months ago. And can I ask what what led you to go to the GP in the first place?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): and my long term boyfriend broke up with me and it was such a shock I really wasn't expecting it. And it's got me really down and felt really lonely and and I didn't really want to see people and she wanted a baby in space and the mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and and he is her family to you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it sounds you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it. kind of came out of the blue a bit and, and that you've been on your own quite a lot. you're not been seeing people as much and it sounds your mom, notice that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I nothing's really changed, nothing's really improved. I feel down absence and feel distant from things and I said, I can't stop all over.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): And I was kind of disappointed in myself, because I feel maybe else my ages doing this, like, I should have been able to snap out of it. Like, it's another thing that I've not really affects me make me stand out for the wrong reasons.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you feel it's kind of odd or unusual to be here, coming to see a clinical psychologist, I suppose I want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't auto strange at all. it sounds it was quite hard for you to come here today. what I guess led you to do that because it sounds maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): And I'm hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't I didn't really want to admit it, because it's another failure. But my mom was talking to me and, and she's, she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving and I don't really want to disappoint her again. And I thought there's no harm in this
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): sounds partly you're doing it then your mum because you're a bit worried that she she isn't pleased with you at the moment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And I think it's great that you've come here. And definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression and particularly the type of therapy that we're going to be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. And I'll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I'm trying to find out a bit more about you today. I saw from your notes that your medic student
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, and not currently in the Unii room and but yeah, last year as a medical student,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay, I guess what, why, what's, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): and I he is pretty tall fast as a then suggested I took a year out. This is the Break.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, thinking that would be about six months ago was it that your ear out started, and it sounds then maybe your first year was also quite tough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, was that I thought we still for everyone, but obviously we'll take it in different ways daily.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And you're planning on the panning on returning.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And yeah I am gonna have to really so. Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): don't sound too sure about that though?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): I think return is probably that's what's gonna make everyone happy. And I think you know, at least I'll be able to finally achieve something and get something right. yeah, next year, I'm going to get through it. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it doesn't, it doesn't sound you want to go back.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I do. And I do. Enjoy it, I I don't feel mate the main man and I just, it's a lot of flack and a lot of pressure and but that's what comes with it and, you know, it'll work out for the best if I go.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, I guess in there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment. And I'm wondering In the meantime, what are you what are you up to what have you been doing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): And I've not really had much on the horizon men more men, have friends owns a restaurant. And she suggested that did a better way to sit in there. deliver a bit money and stuff because I've seen that in Uni. So, you know, I've done that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, how many shifts have you done there?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): And I've only done one far. And yeah, I don't know whether it's something that I'd probably go back to but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): okay. How when was that shift?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It was last week actually.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, and how was it, I suppose I'm intrigued. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): it was, it was different, you know, because it was I could. I did enjoy it because there's like, it's different aspects and I had to like, speak to people and like, try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. Like, I wasn't very good. But I suppose it was handy to have some money and, like, get out of the house.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it sounds you quite enjoyed that then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what makes you think you weren't very good?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I I bit slow and people sometimes they didn't stand by science, I'd have to talk louder or quieter or slower and a bit confused sometimes with the orders. And then don't really think that I'm not really a friendly. Like, people don't really think that I'm a friendly person. They didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt I was inconveniencing them by like, asking them things and getting things wrong. But yeah, they said they said that apparently and most people got a few mistakes on the fascia.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): gosh. Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): up to dear.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Does that sound with you?

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Great. should we have a look at your blood test? Yes. Yeah. Here it is. what we're testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, and to show you the normal range for Women is between 11.5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right? And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8.7.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All that slows.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's a bit lower than we would like. what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And it's very treatable as well. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Oh, yes. I mean, this tightness, it's getting me down doctor.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I must be, because you've got quite a busy lifestyle.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, yeah. And I can't cope with it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Yeah. Shall I tell you a bit more about anemia? Do you know anything about the condition?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I mean, I've heard of it, but I don't know what it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It is the condition relates to your blood right. Within your blood there's several components, one of which is plasma. Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely. Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): One of the causes can be blood loss. I wondered about your periods. How are they?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, they've been heavy these last few months really heavier. I pass it down to my age, you know, this stuff getting irregular and heavy. And, but you might be right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable, you know, balanced diet. We eat a lot of ready meals. And then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties I think it's quite good diet rightYes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): teenage children they keep you busy.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): they do. Yes. I mean, you know it's having a taxi service you know what with that and and then at work you know busy at work it tired. I'm getting tired
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It must be hard for you to do all those things.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Yes. Yeah, it's difficult. I feel yourself can't cope anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All doctor
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Oh, right. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Oh, yes. Yeah, you're nice day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, exactly. Also liver is a good source of iron.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): No, no, no, no couldn't eat liver.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What about something steak that you mentioned? Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, yes. I mean state one day to Kaku toll, you know, because now to go good. Yes. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's also leafy green vegetables, things kale and spinach, a good source of iron.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Ohh the kids wouldn't eat that. But, I mean, they sweet corn they can have the sweet conch and they were the same and I could go for the leafy green vegetables. Broccoli, there's broccoli?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. Yeah, I broccoli. You know,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Ohh good, good I would go with that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's other things too. You might want to consider things fortified cereals which have iron. And
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): what are those?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, if you look on the ingredients, panel, cereals, you'll see some are enriched with iron you could perhaps incorporate some of those.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Oh, yes, yes, ill Look in the supermarket. I mean, I've got some of those. We could have a tweak and and that gives me more time to cook or die
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): could make your life a bit easier.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely I would be happy to vote yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): white bread is a good source of iron as well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes. Yeah. No, they only white bread only buy white bread, but I could buy myself some brown bread. cobs and have it for lunch. Yes. Yeah. No good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do you think you could give some of those things a try?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I would try doctor definitely
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): right. Yeah, it's the other thing I'd you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Oh, I'm not into tablets. Why?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. This can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia. And what it does is it supplements the amount of iron and iron you're getting in your diet.
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): will that be short term,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yes, yes. Often people respond very to those. You can have some side effects. Sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on, you know, on an empty stomach. Do you take them after a meal?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All you how to remember to do that? Yes. Yeah.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how do you feel about the information I've given you far outside?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes, I'll definitely try if it makes me feel any better. It's worth it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. Excellent. Yeah, excellent. I've given you quite a lot of information about anemia today. I've got a leaflet here about anemia, which I thought you might to take home and read in your own time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Ohh thank you. Yes, yeah. Oh, yes. Yeah, I'll read this talk. This is sometimes difficult to remember what what your tells yes, having a look at this at home would be really helpful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's right. to check that I've explained things to you correctly, that you could recap on the the two treatments that you're going to try
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): what you said that the Navy was due to a lack of iron and I can get this from Having some red meat I mean, steak lamb chops would that be?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And green vegetables and wholemeal bread and have these iron tablets and you know, hopefully I'll feel better. Thank you.

Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Are there any other tests I'll have to have?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think at this stage, when you come back to see me again, we'll do another blood test and check on your hemoglobin level than if you haven't, if it hasn't gone back into the normal range. It might be then that we look at doing some other investigations. But I don't want to worry about that. At this stage. I think let's see how you do with the dietary change in the iron tablets. And we can discuss that next time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right, thank you. Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Is there anything else?

Some things kind of stand out for me and hearing you talk about what's been happening and your feelings I can appreciate. It's really painful. And I would say to the reader that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts. I think that you'll see it's it's helpful although I know It's a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes. But I'd to try to kind of distinguish between the two. Okay. You said that you've been at your job for about five years. You really your job. tell me about your job, kind of how you felt about it, but frame it in a time before this ever happened.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=2): I my job because I felt I was helping people. it was meaningful. And, you know, when I went there, Time went by fast. it was kind of like, I was enjoying myself, you know, not super fast. I wasn't having the best time of my life, but it was something where I would go and you know, I felt I was doing something important and the day didn't drag on and, you know, I got along with my co workers and that kind of thing. it felt meaningful to me. meaningful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you remember accomplishing things at that job that you felt benefits society, the people you help.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I feel like, you know, doing my job, I got to know people, you know, help people out with things that they needed. You know, when things were bad I could, you know, get kids out of situations that were really dangerous for them and, you know, no one else was going to do that for them. I felt I was the kind of person that was making keeping people safe. I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You kept people safe. And you had a lot of satisfaction from the work you did. And now doesn't feel that way?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Now, not at all.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): I mean, I guess it's like, quantitatively the same as before. I do the same things with families. But now I kind of feel I can't trust my own judgment everything. Before everything kind of felt a little more black and white, and now it feels everything is much a shade of gray that I can't tell. You know what's and what's wrong anymore. And every time I feel I have a good instinct I doubt it I question it I have all these ideas of, well, you know, if I remove the kids from this family, what if they're not really doing the things? I think they're doing? what if the parents are good parents? What if the kids get put into a home that's bad for them?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this is maybe what's different. This what you're saying from before till now? Is decisions seemed clear cut.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, sometimes it was tougher than others, but it seemed more I could make a decision and kind of wipe my hands of it and, you know, move on to the next thing. And now I feel there's all these doubts in my head and all these questions about if I'm doing the thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself a lot of self doubt. Now you're looking at decisions as much more difficult. It's much more difficult to come to the decision. And second guessing sounds move to second guessing a bit. When you do make a decision, playing over over your mind. What could go wrong here? Is that the thought you're having?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, yeah, definitely. I feel I'm second guessing everything.

Which, I guess maybe I shouldn't be that freaked out about because there have been other people who have made mistakes and like, the supervisors have talked to them and, you know, even then they didn't lose their jobs. it's not like, you know, I, you know, I don't know, I guess it's not hearing them, or thinking that they're judging me is an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, you can see that I'm talking this through you can see that. some of this could be feelings. Thoughts you're having, combined with what you're observing share, you're filtering your observations in a way that's maybe making them seem a little more destructive, or more negative.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it's kind of like, I know, it's not that big of a deal because, I said, My supervisor hasn't talked to me and it's not I've heard anything terrible about anything happening to the kids or anything that. But I feel like, you know, I have those thoughts like, oh, was she you know, saying something? You know, when she said that? Did she was she referring to what happened? and stuff that?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can you can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where where they said something that you thought maybe was referring back to this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Yeah. we were having our regular work week. And we kind of like, you know, discuss how things are going. And it's been kind of a big deal what, you know, more than usual that the kids were removed from this family. So, you know, one of my co workers kind of nudged me and said, like, oh, you're the bulldozer you, you know, you plowed through that family took those kids away. And, you know, I think she meant it kind of, as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say, like, you know, you did what you needed to do, but it kind of made me feel does she think that I'm callous? Like, does she think that I didn't care and you get what I'm saying?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): she referred to as a bulldozer. And one way to take that would be powerful, efficient. Another way to take that would be kind of destructive we talked about before destructive powers. They're mechanical they don't have a lot of feeling.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you don't know exactly know how she meant it but you're thinking maybe it was negative
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): yeah. And I guess it kind of goes back to my fear that I didn't think it through that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you know, it makes me feel Was I being mechanical? Was I was I nonchalant about it? Should I have put more thought into it? And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt I guess you know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are maybe you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Or even thoughtful. I guess maybe I was being, you know, going about my job without putting a lot of thought into What I was doing exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment. At the time making a decision, you would have thought through the steps more.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, maybe taking a little bit more time.
Summary: The patient has been concerned about the work atmosphere where they feel others think that the patient hasn't made the right decision. The patient acknowledges their colleagues have made mistakes but they didn't lose their jobs. The patient feels the negative feelings they get may indicate something bad is going to happen to them. The patient's colleague passed a comment of them being like a bulldozer plowing the kids out of the family. This in a negative sense is perceived as being mechanical and destructive. The patient feels they could have put in a little bit more thought into their decision.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Afternoon. I'm glad you could get in today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm still anxious.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety, and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety. And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee. You were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature. I'm wondering how all that went?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes, I didn't I didn't really do that. I did cut back on my coffee a little bit, but I find that it wakes me up in the morning. So, you know, I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups. And I did take the dog for a walk. But I haven't really gotten out other than that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it sounds you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds you had a little bit of an issue. Getting out more with people.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I don't. I don't really to go out with people. There's usually a lot of a lot of chatter, a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's uncomfortable for you to be To around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking, and how does that make you feel?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It makes me feel a little bit nervous. And then when I get out there, I don't really, I don't really engage in conversation.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, getting out with people makes you even more anxious. I'm wondering what we could do about that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That would absolutely be one option. You could invite people over to your house, and then you could get to choose who you're around.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's a good idea.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And in terms of the yoga, let's get back to the yoga for a minute. Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, I looked at my gym. I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying To go to a gym, and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else. that's why I didn't really look anywhere else.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. And if I were to ask you now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to 10?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe about a five or six.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, well, I, I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I want to do it. I'm interested in doing it, it's really hard.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when you see the pictures on your newsfeed, it makes you excited about doing it. But when you go to do it, it makes it more challenging.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I haven't done it before. it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible Other people?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. And you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people. I'm wondering if that's what Yoga is about flexibility?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I think I think that people go to become flexible. But I think that maybe some people are already flexible.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And you'd be a beginner?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, I feel embarrassed, I think. And then if the teacher tried to get me to do it, and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose, and I think it would be embarrassing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain policies. And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I think I feel really good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Right? I guess it's the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): What would what would cause you to not being able to do it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): The causes are not we're not sure. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. And I'm wondering, what would make that difference between then and now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, when I was a kid, I used to practice a stretch a lot, and now that I don't, I don't have the same flexibility. Mm hmm. as I've gotten older, I've lost a lot of flexibility
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you let it be embarrassed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, it would be okay. But I don't I don't that feeling.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What would be the payoff? Do you think? If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I probably feel really good in the end.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You know, I can give you I've lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I didn't really know that. I thought that that you'll go was For about flexibility, I didn't realize there were many other benefits.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Good, good. That's a definite improvement. And, and you could determine after that first class, whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not. And that, would that be validation for you? Or would that be? It gives you even more motivation? If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think that would be a lot of motivation to continue.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. one other thing that I wanted to, to mention to you was, you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature. Wow.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It was only about 30 minutes. It was really cold and windy. we didn't want to stay out. And by we I mean the dog and I Mm hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And because of it, it was cold and windy. You decided to kind of cut the walk short. Yeah. And and that's definitely understandable. I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Wow. It might help if I take a jacket next time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, if you took a jacket in cases cold, yeah. And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful, that you could be in that would help you even more. Enjoy it
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): as long as I'm away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better. Okay, and there's lots of trails around my house that. Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): excellent. Is It's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Probably.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And on a scale of one to 10 tell me what that probably means.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's probably attend. I can I can commit to that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. it sounds last week, you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes. But you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you you could do them at home.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): If I could do them at home, I would probably do them all the time. Mm hmm. I think that would be a big difference.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And then there would be no embarrassment factor. If you couldn't do the poses less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good. And get out more with people, you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think it's a 10. I think I can do them on all four all four.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Fabulous and how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week? How much of a difference Do you think it would make you feel?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if I were doing them on a regular basis. Mm hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And how would it make you feel?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It would make me feel really good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And you'd feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you much.
Summary: The patient feels anxious. The patient hasn't done yoga classes, cut back on coffee a bit to one cup and taken dog out for a walk. The patient does not like chattering people so find hard to go out with people. One idea discussed was to invite people over home. The patient explains they would feel embarassed if they are not able to do yoga poses. The therapist clarifies yoga reduces anxiety a lot and the patient readily agrees to it. The next idea was to use jacket and take trails around the house that are less noisy for walking the dog. The therapist suggests to do yoga poses at home and that would be no embarassment. The patient confidently agrees they can do all of them on a regular basis.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Good. How you doing?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I understand you had some symptoms recently they've been bothering you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Could you tell me about those?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, you know, I have this position at work where I have to make these weekly presentations and, and it's killing me. I can't do it anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Tell me about how these presentations are set up.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it's a it's, it's the executive director and it's 10 managers, we're kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does a weekly program update. Five minutes or maybe 10. At the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted. And but everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around kind of around in a circle. And you know, depending on where you said is what order you present and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and you say that this situation the presentation you said it's killing you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): would feeling you have
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I feel it's constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation. And even though I only have to speak for five minutes, I'm consumed by by this part of my job that I can't I can't do anything else and I normally feel I do good in my job but but this and, you know, it just, it builds up more every day the day before is is really bad because I'm prepping for the meeting. And it really starts to consume me then I don't sleep the night before. And then by the time you know, I get to the meeting I'm, I'm anxious and nervous, I'm panicking and everything, and I can't. I can't.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, this is this is distressing for you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And this is probably difficult to, to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what's going on then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I'm, I'm, I feel I'm breathing harder. I'm starting to sweat. And I feel my face is turning red. My palms are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pants. I My heart is racing. And I feel you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel everything gets worse. I feel I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder. I feel everybody can hear it. My stomach gets in knots, I feel nauseous. And I can't, you know, there have been times that I've managed to hold my hand still, and sit really still. And I've tried some deep breathing and satin and have made it through. And I have have made it to my, my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words, and I don't say everything I need to even I have a cheat sheet essentially. And I can reframe it. I still feel I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out and my voice doesn't project I end up speaking very softly and I said, I'm stuttering, I can't get it. Even then, it's it's still I feel it's still a mess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You're not you're not happy with the quality of your prison. Now even even when you're able to kind of stay there and conducted, I want to divide this into the stages. we talked about the very beginning. you're already having anxieties sounds it's fairly intense at that point. Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations. Tell me about what you're feeling as, as the presentations come around to you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, if I if I manage somehow to get there early enough, and I can get an early enough seat to sit next to my boss, or like, one or two away, then I'm pretty okay. Because I can, I can kind of get it over and done. But many times I'm nervous and honestly, a bit hungover because I've been drinking too to try and I don't feel anxious want to drink. there have been a lot of times that I've I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking. And by the time I get there, one of the last, it's one of the last seats, I'm one of the last to go. And as it gets closer and closer to me, I feel more and more anxious and panicky. And here in, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave, I can say, I've got to go.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): before before the presentations come around to you, you get up and yeah, leave the room. in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation, the anxiety, the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room and when it comes to you giving your presentation. You're not happy with that but what strings it level during your presentation.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I feel during the presentation, I feel almost everything. everything stops. And then and then when it's done, and it goes to whoever's next. It's like, it's almost a physical sense of relief. Like, okay, that's over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable. I am so, upset with how I performed that, that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like, What is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again, and I feel miserable, that that I've I feel I've disappointed him and I've I've disappointed me. And I mean, this has always, always happened to me. For as long as I can remember, I've never been able to speak in front of groups and you know, from back in college. If I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there's a way out of it. And if they refuse, then I wouldn't present. And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation, and I dropped the class and I took it again, with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it. And High School is the same that I would, you know, I wouldn't do it. And actually, this is ridiculous. You know, I mentioned drinking. I've been drinking for a really long time. When I was like, I don't know like, 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some, adolescent treatment and I had to do this group therapy with these other kids and I couldn't do that i bolted out of the room and never been able to do this ever.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): See if you've had these symptoms for a long time, they've been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, if I haven't had to be in front of other people I've been I've been kind of you know, I can go to the movies but I to sit on yet and you know, I can go out with with my family and my friends and we can go shopping but I don't to go to new places. I to go kind of the same places that have familiar Yeah, yeah. Cuz because I know them. You know, I know The layout of stores and things that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it interferes with your functioning. Maybe a little bit. But if you're not having to present, it's not as big a deal as it is now for you. Yes job.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's really affecting it. are you taking any measures? Or have you take any measures other than drinking, you mentioned, to avoid a situation to avoid?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Oh, definitely. I mean, there's I said, I mean, I've run out of the meetings. There's been times that I've called in sick when I haven't been there's been times when I've, I've said I've had car trouble arrived late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation. I've talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and giving my notes to him or to brief him before after and because I have to say that I have this problem. I mean, Normal people don't do this, right? I mean, normal people can make these presents, the rest of the staff can do it, why can't I? And I don't want to tell him that, you know, I that there's something wrong with me. I mean, it's, it's gotten to the point that I've talked to him about, you know, this other position that's in another department and transferring that I wouldn't have to do this anymore. And and it would it would be a pay cut. I mean, it's a demotion but I can't live this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): This is too painful. If you had the other job, his other job would involve presentations. you'd be happier. You'd have fewer symptoms in that job. What's been the result of that discussion? Has there been anything has happened as far as well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): He has told me that he thinks something In a good job
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): excuse me, and he doesn't want me to. Here's what I'm going to change positions. But I can't, I can't do this anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right, you've you've tried, you try to cope with anxiety. You've had to leave colon, colon sick or come in late. You've looked for different position or doesn't involve presenting. You've had this problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations before
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you or have you seen any symptoms this and your parents?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually. We were kind of joke about it. Some times that we all get nervous. And my sister, I don't know how but she managed to find a job where she doesn't interact with anybody.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It's her in her office with our computer by herself. And it's just, it's hurt. I don't know how she pulled it off. I mean, she doesn't. She hardly talks on the phone.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And she's really happy and my parents they they they met in college. When my dad after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like, you know, I could tell you're really nervous, but today great and they they seem to bond over this nervousness that they both had.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right? there may be maybe a history, a family history of symptoms. these, this distressing for you, you tried to avoid it and deal with it but you haven't been you don't feel you've been very successful coping with it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): We'll get you in for treatment we'll catch in the next couple days to see a counselor. If that's what you'd to do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, please
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): think that could help. And I want to thank you for spending this time with me. It's really helped me to understand better what you're, you're facing.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): my advice would be for you or your daughter to at least and a week at the program.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Again she needs to get the feel no we can't do that I there there's no way I can take her I can't I couldn't drag her back there. Either any of those programs.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): at least whenever out of your busy schedule,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I came across a program, which is perfect for her. And I really would for you to help me see if this could work. And I'd rather for you to try to do that instead of me shopping around for other programs because far the ones that have been offered me have not worked.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the program that you're interested, you want me to go with you or you want me to, I want you to want me to do
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I want you to see if, if, if I could choose that program instead of one or the others that you have offered.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, they were they were not not good for her.

And also, I was happy with that. But then I know one of my co workers, he had his birthday. I was like, Oh, let me do something nice for him. And I went home and I baked the cake, but it's kind of annoying, because when I got there, he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that he said over the hill, but he's like, old, I thought it'd be funny, but it wasn't apparently. But yeah, besides that, like, this week's been awesome. And, you know, I said, I got my promotion and made a lot of money. with a nice increase, I should say.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, he's worried because I went on a shopping spree he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don't really want to tell him I might I might because I'm proud of myself I deserve it and I you know, we're still hard for long in this company. And with the shopping spree was kind of treating myself. And I've gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money. I maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don't have a lot of bills now. I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, I could pay for it. that's why he's worried. And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have one of those things to attach it. it didn't work out. And I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit in my car and he couldn't come help me. besides I've been fine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you haven't you haven't gotten any trouble at work, or at home or anything?

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Alisa How you doing today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Good? How are you?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): How has the anxiety been going?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. I think
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm getting to a point where it's under control.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I had to clean one of my co workers aside because I feel they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): no.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Or I feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel like, I deserve it. You know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and kind of made me feel a fool, basically. I I didn't understand.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I mean, I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you criticized other coworkers?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do you think that her criticism was within normal limits within the what you've kind of seen there regularly
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it felt she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): at the time when you were?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. where do you stand with her now? the meeting? Well,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I've been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess the confrontation I had whether
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Was this criticism?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): She criticized me and I felt disrespected.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's a feeling
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): being upset and disrespected and again yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, if we, go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): confronted her,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you confronted her? Right. you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but I said, this is a cyclical. you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that make some some sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sure, exactly. it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's kind of anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's getting there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Tough though as you mentioned, what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): gosh, Um, since I was a teenager. long time
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. changing it's going to be work.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it'll be your first physiological reaction, and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, I talked about, right, which is, I'd respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel they give me. it's mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Well, I think
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): over time, if I learned to do that I first starting within side of me I wouldn't get that initial Like,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): punched in the gut.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'd be able to do that I
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): talking with her.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): and then go from there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things like, and it was a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship that it functions.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't want them to have to come and sort that out. Right, you can sort out their own. And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking. is that something you feel you can try over the course of the next week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I will definitely try.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): really our plan move forward as a couple parts. one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware what's going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. I know that's tough. That's gonna be that's gonna be the challenge, right? But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice. Does it all make sense to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it's pretty clear. You explained it really well. Thank you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, let's work on those two, those two elements. and next time you come in, we'll check in on those two and make any needed modifications to our strategy and we'll kind of move forward from there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that sounds good.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sounds great.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks, Lisa.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.

I didn't want to be in how do I put this little Like, I want it to be in control. And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, I didn't let myself drink too much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much. You know, like, think about it. Think about all the things that can happen to you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I understand exactly what you're saying. And
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how much are you drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's, it's mainly for social gatherings. it's nothing that I do, by myself or whatever. It's the
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's like, every weekend.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): every other weekend, I would say,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Tommy, I'm concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, are your friends the problem? maybe you should start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself, I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've been following in their footsteps to because it seems what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think you really need to quit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, alcohol is prevalent in our society and it's around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel I should get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important. Yeah,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I, I I don't see the problem in it now. And maybe it's because I haven't really had that dramatic of an experience. But,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): um, do you want to wait for that to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You're right. I don't want I don't want to be too far gone. Before it's too late. I, I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much, or affected anybody close to me that much. I guess it's something that I feel I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you that you can get to trial here and stop drinking.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into an A life of possibly being sober and experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Sounds good.

<PrimaryTopic: anxiety> <SecondaryTopic: presentation> <GlobalEmotion: -0.05>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, let's see if we could talk about the moment of the presentation again. I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Let's go before the moment you're still in the, you're still sitting down, and you're getting ready to present. Let's say your second present. Yeah, we've talked about and you're thinking they're going to seeming as anxious. They're gonna think I don't belong here. These are the right. Okay. these thoughts occur because you have an expectation rule one add to that you brought into that class, when you walked into that class, you have these expectations already. It's perfectly natural. It's not or wrong. Everyone has these beliefs. And whenever these beliefs are and we'll talk about that another point, they combined with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you, right, and the classmates watching you, and they result in these thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And the beliefs, they're not good or bad. They don't say anything about the person having them. They're thoughts. Actually, they're fairly understandable and natural thoughts. The problem is that they lead to symptoms. So, you're sitting there at your desk, and you're thinking, they're gonna see that I'm anxious. They're gonna realize I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough, right? What reaction Do you have when you have that far?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I guess I'm very observant, I started looking around, like, I'm sweating. I'm having physical responses, and I'm looking around to see if anyone's already looking at me, hyper vigilance.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): distressing symptoms.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What's something that you could send yourself in that moment, that would maybe get in between that thought, and that reaction, that thought of, I'm not gonna know I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough. And that reaction
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, I think in that moment, most people are looking at the person who's presenting and not at me. And that, you know, I can maybe like, take some deep breaths or try to calm myself down. Maybe look over my notes one more time. Because they're all watching the person who is presenting not me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. some some deep breathing, looking over your notes, preparing yourself for kind of focusing on that and realizing they're not really looking at you anyway for a moment. Okay, good. Good. Um, you bring your notes with you to class?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, usually have index cards, or maybe some stats on something that I want to look over some numbers or something I don't want to forget.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. You always have those with you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it speaks to self worth.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, now it's not good. Well, I mean, I've been arguing with my husband, I've been drinking a lot more, you know, the depression has come back a lot worse. it's starting to become the cycle where you know, drinking and getting into arguments and situations not getting better and it keeps snowballing keeps snowballing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And these these behaviors are all things that potentially could impede your goal. it is kind of a self fulfilling prophecy element to this. Yeah. Do you agonize you worry, invest in these thoughts? Right? And then to temporarily take away the pain you drink? Yeah. That ends up being more dysfunction, with a relationship with your husband. Yeah. Imagine if you're intoxicated, you're not looking for new work. Yeah. That wouldn't be ideal timing. So, in a sense, you're, you're not helping things to improve. And it all kind of starts without thinking,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): but it's hard when I'm really depressed and the situation's not getting better. And I'm home sitting about, you know, drinking, while everyone else is carrying on with their life, and I'm stuck here.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that ties into that kind of worthless, type five. you're fulfilling that role. worthless. That sounds manifesting for you. And that's one thing you can do. That's an option you can drink and you could have relational struggles. But is that really? Is that really what you want at all? Is that the most useful?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Really? No, it's not helping.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How do you think you could break that cycle?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I've been thinking about, you know, trying to get more organized, we talked about before with the finances and, and trying to, you know, figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want, what to do and maybe by baby steps, it's not like, overwhelming for me the thought of getting a new job and making enough money and providing for my family. And breaking it down.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, that makes sense. Yeah, the first step would be figuring out what The minimum amount you really need, right? you'll shoot for hire full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which I want free time to decline. Right? it makes sense. armed with that information and you could go into the workplace, right? And it was less anxiety kind of know this Job's gonna if I get it, that's good, Lord, I might as not apply to this one because it's not gonna work. as efficient as time say, it's good. That sounds logical.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think sometimes the fear of the unknown, like, worry about what if this never happens for me? You know, what if I don't get a job? You know, what if we lose our house?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That worries Yeah, no worries. nagging Yeah. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, worst case, if we don't get a job, I mean, probably. I don't know, like, get a smaller house, or find a way around it. I mean, she would need to have some tough times.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. It would be difficult, right? To be fair, right? It would be difficult, but you would adapt.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right? like, it would be difficult but I think if I really thought about it, you know, we would probably get through it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if we pick up with that we say that's really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive responses to automatic thoughts, right? if you're telling yourself that you have the depression and certainly anxiety, craving to drink, you tell yourself well, the worst that could happen is I don't work the rest of my life again, acknowledging that's pretty unlikely. But the worst thing to happen is I won't work again. And I might have to adapt, I might have to have a simpler life in terms of material goods and small house, but I would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood, or your thoughts?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I think when I really think about it, you know, you said, I think I'm less depressed or think that I, you know, I'm more able to cope with it. You know, knowing Okay, well, this is the worst that could happen, but maybe it's not as bad as I thought. would be embed.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's a piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what the worst case scenario could be. Right? And probably another part of the adaptive response could be, you know, I could live to the worst case scenario. I think it's important to acknowledge that it's unlikely. that's unlikely. Right? statistics probability is on your side here. Right? So, as you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment, you'll probably have some, some interviews, we don't get a job offers, right. But eventually, if I have one where you do, yeah, right. It's, it's math. Right? If you can accept the worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption, reduce that depression, anxiety.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Let's end there for today. But I want you to try for the next week. I want to try plan that adaptive response, right? Actually, there's two we're talking about right? One is you could survive the worst case scenario. And the other one is that probabilistically It won't happen. Right? you have kind of two. Well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up, like, I'm never gonna work again. Okay, this is a catastrophe. that self talk. Yeah, apply that self talk. identify that automatic thought, because we've talked about that skill, right? And then apply that self talk away. All right, and let's see, you have the thought record. Right. when that you know, when you can fill one of those out, okay, when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response, even if you can't get it completely filled out, I understand that. I know there's a lot on there. what you can get done on that. Anything you can do. That would be helpful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sound good?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): scheduled for one week. I'll see you then we'll see how this goes to progress we can make on this on the alcohol and the depression and anxiety.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Jason, how you doing, sir?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You all right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm here.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You're here, here. I understand that you're in the hospital a couple weeks ago.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): What happened?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): yeah, about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, that the government can't hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors. And I was trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and picked out a tool and brought it back to the house. And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. it's like, see the government data to get
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what you think the government is trying to do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): They're trying to stop me from creating my room. Because they're, they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them. And I'm not a follower. And I know what I want. And I know what I need. And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need. And I'm trying to protect them by creating my room.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And tell me about your room. What what are you doing there that makes that special.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is sending you through the lights and also through the TV and through every electronic apparatus that is out there. And I'm creating doll or a wave neutralizer that it can stop that from happening. that you can live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that how you were feeling when you were building?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room. And anytime I'm in there I was, it was good. I had energy. I didn't have everything that I wanted. But my prototype was running out of fuel. And I needed to make it bigger, larger, it can run longer.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's what you're trying to do
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wouldn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online. And they were also supposed to become be shipped in that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor's house. It could have been all perfect and set that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could plug it in. And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could be happy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): They could be happy, they could be happy, like, you know, you were happy.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): I was happy, like, two weeks ago, I was I was good. I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create. I can build my base in my system. But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to not sleep because I need sleep. I wasn't tired. And if I did sleep, I slept for 15 minutes, because I needed to finish what I was going to do. And I was close to finishing and my neighbour called cops.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you had a period of time when you had a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Doesn't everybody do that?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You're also happy and felt energetic
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): I felt good. when I when I sleep I don't when I sleep because it feels wrong.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how do you feel now in comparison?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm guy. All right. All right, now. The government maybe get on different medication. all right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): not happy or sad.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): not sad either. It's you In the middle
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you want to get back to that happiness
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): of course who doesn't want to get back to the happiness of their life. That's the reason why you need to finish machine
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. You mentioned you ordered some products online. How much did you order?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): um, I think I ordered probably know the exact number I ordered 236 hard drives, because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom, I can always be happy and if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered. But then within that 236 it also covered my house that my family could be happy, and my four neighbors around us we can all be happy. And that's the reason why I'm kind of angry at my one neighbor because I was including his house in all By my grid that he can also be happy all the time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): He would have been affected by a machine.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Of course, he's the helping hand. He helped me out. He let me borrow his tools. but evidently he didn't let me borrow him this time. pull him out. Have another neighbor take his place.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Were all those hard drives fairly expensive?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know. When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment. I found my mom's purse and I was like, my god, she has a credit card in there. my god, I can use our credit card. I was using our credit card because it's trying to make her happy. And I don't know I added the 236. They were probably 50 to $100 apiece, depending on where it could get them and I ordered them.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How'd your mother respond to that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): My mom came to the hospital and was like, where are all these boxes coming from? It's this, but I'm in my room. And she put them into my room. And then, a week ago, she has, like, I see my credit card, and she wants to happen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that strange relationship?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, that's how we have a relationship generally
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you get along, okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): we get along perfectly fine. that's, that's how we talk to each other. Like, we talk to each other minimally, because she's not in my room, she's not happy. anytime she does come into my room, it messes up the balance. I get unhappy, and then I tell her to stay out that I can be happy and she can be happy in her own place.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you mentioned that they changed medications in the hospital.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): The government changed for Medications

Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you found yourself as motivated these last couple weeks as you were before you're hospitalized?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now? I haven't been that motivated. Big. I know I'm going to get it done. It's I don't know if I'm gonna get it done today or tomorrow, but I know what's gonna get done.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's really important because I Can't be controlled by the government anymore.
