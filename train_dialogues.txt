Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that something that you haven't been doing?

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That would probably make it more likely for me to go. I don't have to be at work until the afternoon that day. I can maybe go asleep and a little bit maybe at 10 o'clock on Sunday.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, lately when I haven't felt doing things that I really need to do, I'll give myself a reward.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hello stone,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hi, I'm PJ Daniels. Sorry, let me wash my hands.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Call me, Dorothy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Oh, thank you. That's the next thing I was going to ask you. Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what's going on?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency. And they treated me by putting this tube down my throat. And I tried to, to tell them and gesture at them that I don't want this tube down my throat. And I hope that never happens again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. No, I totally understand that. I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through. And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked it. Talk to me about this. I had a little bit of a look through your charts. I think I understand why they did it. But did anybody explain it to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, not really. And because I was gasping for air and in the state I was, but I'll tell you what, I'm really worried that this won't happen to me again. I don't want that to be anymore. I'm, I'm to to pass this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Absolutely. And you know what? There's no answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive, the two, we really want to know what the patient values in terms of, you know, things that are that invasive, and absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want. But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I have congested Part failure. And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly. I was living in my soul, the ambulance brought me in to the emergency. they that was how they were treating me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you pretty much showed up to emergency. And very quickly they put that tube down.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's correct.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Did anybody ask you if you were with that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don't want the tube but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): they didn't quite pick up on that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I guess not. And, you know, I've had that three times already. I don't want to go through with
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): the two you've had.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. I don't want it anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. And you have congestive heart failure, and it sounds you've got a breathing problem. Yes. And do you know why they would have put the tube down. Do you know what they were trying to do?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I guess because I was short of air. I had a hard time breathing, right? they tried to, like, I'm going to use the word save me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Right. it sounds you understand that. I mean, usually we only put a tube in. If that was the only thing we could do to save you. Most of the time of congestive heart failure. We'll give some medications. Have you heard of lasix? Or furosemide? No, okay. It's a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don't think we have time to give it that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. haven't had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I I guess so. But I'm with dying. Okay. You know, I says, I've lived a good life and if it If the good Lord says that it's my time, I'm with that. And you wouldn't put it to
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, my know already what I'm hearing from you. Exactly. I'm gonna say exactly what you've said, sounds you've lived a good life. You've been through this a few times, you know exactly what it involves. And if I could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage. Is that correct?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That is correct. And, but you know, what, doctor? How can I be assured that my wishes are respected, I don't get this tube down?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): That's an excellent question. first, I did want to answer your previous question, based on what we're talking about. Absolutely. I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then of course, your second question, which is great, as as how do we make sure this doesn't happen? what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too. And your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care. And I it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. And that notes available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing to I reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that to Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All Thank you. I'm I was concerned about that and yes, I I think I will rest now because I say, that was a horrendous experience. And he says it won't happen again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. I do want to ask you a few other questions related to this. Go ahead. And the first question might sound a little off putting, but I sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want. We do have to ask, how was your mood? How are you feeling?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'm I'm feeling fine. My mood is fine. I have no no problems.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, excellent. And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital? when you're healthy as healthy as you can be? Say a few weeks ago?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I think I am enjoying life. Okay. Yes, I am enjoying life to the to the best I can.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, great. Yeah. And then other related questions, we did talk about the two that we wouldn't put it in. But again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want. Okay? if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Certainly, Oh, yes. Oh, look at medication, not the intubation.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone found you at home, who had passed away. Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, no, no, I I said, the good Lord knows when it's my time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No, and that'll make sense to me with no breathing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, and I have no problems with that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): There are some other things we can do. That's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive. And one is have you ever heard of bipap?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't think so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's a mass that really pushes air into you. It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube. Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don't know what that is. But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try a mask, and we would do it as long as you were with it and comfortable at the time,
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): would it be for a long time?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now, usually, most times with bipap? It's only about two to six hours for most patients.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that would be with me. Okay. And if
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff, and take you to the intensive care unit. Again, we wouldn't do breathing too, but this is to watch you closely.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I would be with that. Yes, yes. It doesn't sound invasive to me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I needed to be reassured that that it won't happen again. And and yeah, I'm, I know that on my chart. It's there. Yes, yes. And that's all I need to hear because I was concerned. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I do want to say that this is not set in stone, in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again. But if we don't hear from you, this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart. I want you to know that in case anything were to change,
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): okay. if I change my mind, I can I will talk to you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Absolutely.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't think I'll change.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't think you will either. But it's nice to see that you're aware of that. Okay. Um, honestly, I mean, there's some other questions. I tend to ask people when I don't know them. Well, kind of routine stuff. Okay. And maybe we'll quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure Anything else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Um, that's it. I'm beginning with an ass but I can't remember what it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's okay. We can usually we have it written down. Yeah, your medications. I think I saw you're on aspirin and two jocks and I think two others. Do you happen to know or have them written down?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You don't want I always carry this paper with me because I can't remember the name. okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, you are on the water pill? The furosemide. Okay,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And. Okay, great. Yeah. Um, any allergies?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And I won't ask but anything that runs in your family, given your age, they told me you're 70 Is that correct?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That is correct.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. And I do have to ask the following Questions completely unrelated to what we're talking about. That's okay. Do you smoke at all?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I don't
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): drink any alcohol.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, no.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And this will be sound crazy, but I have to ask any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I never had the opportunity
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to test any over the counter herbals In addition to these.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I don't take any of those.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And where are you living now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm living in a convalescent home for the last six months. I used to live in my own home. And six months ago, I'm moved to a convalescent home.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And how do you feel about that? That changed six months ago.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would really prefer my own home. But trouble with my breathing sometimes, right?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you feeling better about being in that place now? A new home
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's okay. Okay, I really have to adjust. I say, if I had my druthers, I'd go back but I guess I have to learn to adjust to this right. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected. one last time. Anything else you want to talk about today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Oh, you answered my question. I was worried about this tube.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Well, it's very nice to meet you and Stone.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I understand that you've come in because you're having a little difficulty in your relationship about that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, basically, it's been getting a little bit worse since we got married. We got married about a year and a half ago. And, you know, the the woman that I married, I thought we were both kind of independent people. And I thought that we would kind of go our separate ways or thing we used to college, but it's kind of gotten to the point now where it's like, I want my own personal space and I I don't want to be left alone sometimes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, you're looking for independence in your relationship. Now, how long have you been together? About a year?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): total four or five years, married for a year and a half.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And when Franklin Did you notice that? What you kind of think it was the problem the independence, lack of independence?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess kind of once we got married after that, it seemed like, you know, we were spending all of our time together, which, you know, at first was great because we're newlyweds, you know, we love spending time together and everything, but I guess probably about, you know, six months to a year after we first got married, it's kind of, you know, progressed to the point where, you know, now it's kind of becoming a burden that whatever I do, she's always there with me. We're always spending every waking moment together and sometimes it's nice to have My own personal space is freedom, you know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're looking for that freedom. Sarah, this kind of resonate with you?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can you can you tell him that?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Frank, what's it to hear that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It kind of Reminds me of how it used to be, you know, like, she said, we've been dating for four or five years and, you know, back then it It wasn't a problem, you know, she could go out and do her own thing I could go out and do my own thing to not have to worry about each other but now that we're spending every moment together, you know, it's I'm always worried about her she's always worried about me and you know, when when I do get the chance to go you know, hang out with some friends or something that. It always feels like, you know, I've pressure on me because I should be with her. She shouldn't be there with me, you know, and I feel I'm doing the wrong thing by trying to be independent try to go do things by myself. I feel guilty. I do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, Sarah, Do you sense that and, frankly, feels guilty about that?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You feel rejected.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this a little bit after. So, I said, probably the first six months to a year it was it was really good. But then, you know, reselling is kind of a burden. You know, always spending time together and trying to make amends and try not to get into fights because we're always spending much time together.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you mentioned that the six months to a year has been the same for you was the beginning of the marriage, something different to what you have that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): for you a couple months after that initial phase. around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriage
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, are you with some space?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't seem real certain.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe this, this idea of space isn't really something you feel will work for you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do want to try to address Frank's concerns about the space?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You seem apprehensive about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe experiment with it, try it for one night and see what happens. So, in the year and a half, you've been married, Is there ever been a night when you've gone out by yourself?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it's been a couple, especially earlier on, which is nice, you know, just, you know, getting to see old friends and you know, our old college friends, like, of course, we attended, you know, events together and seeing old friends and everything that, but there's been, there's been a few times, you know, not, not more than I can count on both my hands, but there's been a few times where I've, you know, gone out and had, like, you know, a guy's night or something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, and what would happened, in terms of between you, so,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): getting out of the house is the hardest part. You know, finding a way to ensure That, you know, it'll be okay. I'm going to be back home later on in the night that she doesn't need to worry about me, you know, if I have any trouble or anything pops up that I need her help, I'll let her know. And, you know, knowing that I love her and telling her that I love her and making sure that she knows that I'll be back. But you know, sometimes it's hard because she gets upset when I tell her that I'm leaving and she doesn't want me to go and she would rather me stay or even take her with me. And you know, I don't want to be the only guy that shows up with my wife. You know, everybody else left their wives at home also. I don't want to be the odd man out
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): all right, this is really an experiment that's already been tried.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): tried twice. Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah. a few times. Is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week, it'll be different?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's not good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Don't you don't think so.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah. mean, we've been doing it, you know, the past couple months, but it seems every time we do is you know the same result it's her getting worried about me and you know me trying to find a way to assure her that it's gonna be and you know that we're married we're still in love, you know everything that, but, you know, it's just, I really want my space and it seems sometimes I can't get out of her crib.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sir, what do you think about that?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. in terms of the going out, although going out with your friends wouldn't have to be on the weekend that something could happen during the week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, absolutely. You know, a lot of my friends normally go out during the week because you know, they have their families and everything to take care of on the weekend. So, yeah, I could definitely go out tonight during the week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you could agree. The both of you could agree to that as kind of terms of this behavioral experiment or weekends, you'll spend those weekends together.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think we could try that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Because that was a concern you specifically brought up. How about Sarah, how about the times during the week? How do you feel about those?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You feel you'd respond better to that? Would that be a better experience?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Something that you think that you could try next week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, let's talk about when because you've gone out before and you said it was getting out. Getting out the house that was the, the real challenge right? walk me through. This really goes through both of you. What we through what happens when you're when you're getting ready to leave when you're planning to head out?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you know, usually I'll go get dressed I'll let her know where I'm going you know, give her my cell phone number you know somebody else's phone number in case my phone is off. tell her what we're going to do you know whether we're going out to to a pole or you know, going to watch some sporting event or something that. No, I would tell her what we're doing, you know, she knows and knows where she can find me. But then after that, it seems as soon as I assure her of what we're doing, and when it's happening, when I'll be home, everything that, it seems all the progress I made towards the front door kind of gets pulled back a little bit because like, she doesn't want me to leave, you know, I can see in her eyes that she's not very happy about me leaving her. And that kind of makes me feel guilty, you know, because I don't want to leave her alone. I want her to be more independent. I kind of want her to, you know, if I'm going out, I would her to go out as well. You know, she says tons of friends. You know, we both have friends. We both have our social circles. And she's kind of it's frustrating when I can't go do my thing, because she's always got to be with me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): ultimately, after all that you you do go, but you feel feel guilty. And do you have a good time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Most of the time, right? Do you know, sometimes I can't get over the fact that you know, my wife at home who's upset at me, and that makes me upset. You know, it's a matter of finding the balance between, you know, my independence and her, you know, doing her own thing because I would her to do that as well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): sometimes you have a good time sometimes you don't. You're worried about Sarah being home. How about when you come home?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When I come home, usually things go back to normal. I mean, we've definitely had our exchange of words after a few times me coming back. But most of the time it goes back to normal, which you know, it's fine. We're very loving, affectionate couple. that's awesome. But you know, most the time it's overbearing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that how you see it Sarah, the way Frank described it?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how about one is out? after after he's left? What do you What are you thinking that? Like?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're anxious something bad's gonna happen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you think that there's been any reason for that thinking, like, do you think there's any basis for thinking something bad's gonna happen?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Absolutely not. No, no, I love Sarah you know, the five years that we've worked together been great, you know, it's it's where we are now as opposed to where we first were, and when we first got married, it's it's changed and you know, I would some independence to be on my own sometimes. And I guess I don't always relay that to her and she doesn't understand why I want my space. I want to go hang out with my friends, but I've been trying to explain to her that, you know, it's, it's a two way street. It's not all one way and we have to work on these issues. And you know, that's why we came to you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, you're really frustrated by not being able to go out, go out. But you're anxious about when he goes out. we talked about the possibility of an experiment or you go out sounds we might run to the same difficulties you experienced before. What can we change to increase the chances of that experiment working?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, if you called when he was at Piedmont The answer is that's something that's normally possible.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah. Most of the time, I'm very good at responding to, you know, making sure that she knows I'm okay. Making sure that she's okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that's a compromise, you'd be willing to make. Absolutely something that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You need any other reassurances from Frank, Sarah?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you have a plan to call Frank? when he's out? Or is it something that you would do if you felt the need to or
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Were you calling for some specific reason?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Why don't you start reinsurance? Everything's going right. Okay, that seems reasonable to you. Right? I mean, I, I guess
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but at the same time, when I'm out doing my own thing, you know, I kind of want that privacy in that, you know, being in the moment you know, because I know when I get back home, from back with you and I'm, nothing's changed because I've always been with you we're still married. But when I'm out with my friends, and you know, I'm getting a couple phone calls during you know, the night over the course of the night and it's having to deal with my wife and having to make sure that she knows I'm and everything that it it gets a little frustrating. It's a little, I mean, frustrating
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Would that be a good compromise? It was a text or two. I guess. That's better than a phone call, right? Yeah. not ideal, but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety a bit. Right? And maybe work toward a little bit more freedom. that's how I can experiment you both combined to try.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, we could try and try it out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Alright. it's not a perfect plan. But it's one that you know, I would hope that we could be successful with if you could, though, you're going through it, maybe track what happens, right, from your own perspective, what you were thinking, the fact left, what you were thinking when you left, how it went, how that separation kind of was conducted. And what happened. Same thing when, while you're out how many times you texted her If you called and then what happened when he got back? Right? That's kind of, and you can you can keep a record of those things independently. You know, you write it down Come your experience and you write down your experience. And we'll come back next time. No matter what happens with it, we'll compare and kind of see what see what happened and how we could make adjustments to to make it work even better.
Summary: The patients got a married one and a half years ago. They have been having trouble with their personal space, being independent and the lack of it, both. Frank has issues to do things independently as he feels pressure to be with her. It makes him feel guilty. Sarah feels rejected. The patients have experimenting hanging out separately twice and it hasn't worked out well. Frank expresses that he feels the need to assure Sarah when he is out, and Sarah feels anxious for the time when Frank is out. Sarah agrees a couple texts and a phone call when Frank is out will help. The therapist asks to note down these experiences before the next meeting of how they both feel, and it can be discussed in the next session.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): between here and there, obviously, if it were easy, you wouldn't need me, you wouldn't have 13 therapists. If this were easy you would have been to a life you wanted a long time ago. it's obvious that it's easy it already be done. Because it sounds you're a person with a lot of motivation works really hard, because there are very few people who wouldn't quit before 13 therapists. that's a very good quality. The very fact that you've gone through all these therapists is a good sign for us. Nonetheless, it is difficult. between here and there, there's going to be hell. Exactly. Right. I figure our number one priority has to be to get you to stay alive through house that we can get to the life you want. If that's where we're at. Now. We got to have some sort of agreement, not by writing a contract. Because I'll fire you if you try to kill yourself that because we both sort of have to face the fact that to get there you got to go through there and to go through there you got to stay alive.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have the use it takes away pain for you to take swings xiety feels good. But then you have these consequences of the law. And you figure those two things out.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I don't know if there is what was your wealth of knowledge. not as
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You can imagine that. it was a good the other side. Can you imagine having further it says law enforcement more charges in the future.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I guess I hadn't really considered that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence. And you'll be more careful in the future.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't know. Yeah, I guess so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): with that thinking, you continue to use as you were, that you would take out the part that got you in trouble.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): First you have to get out of trouble this time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yep.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana, would you continue to use it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I couldn't imagine
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's a social component here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, a little bit. I drink mainly by myself because all my friends work nine five jobs. They don't drink every day. But I do. But on the weekends, all of my friends who I
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): even if you had no anxiety, no pain You'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends. How would they respond if you went out with them? I didn't drink.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Um, they probably wouldn't understand it, because we all go out and we get really drunk and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it'd be socially awkward. straining the relationships with your friends. the quitting alcohol and marijuana stopping use that doesn't seem a good route for you
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But then you have this distressing situation which is making you second guessed some of it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, it's making me think that like, maybe I, I need to, make a change. I can't see that. That's the change I'm making.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you need to make some change. Yeah, but not the alcohol. Drugs.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Something else could change.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I don't know what but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you could reduce your usage, avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal. Would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety of the pain?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Am I not going anywhere ever? I might not drive as often
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that strategy might not work. That's something you've been tossing around though, this idea of isolating a little bit more, and drinking a little less. Seems all your options here kind of grim. Yeah, that's that's me doesn't seem that way to you too.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Now that I'm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): talking through it, yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'd don't think I have any choice really
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): have any choice? What's going to happen is going to happen?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. let's start with the lead now. Pick up with me now. You don't want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with a DUI. What do you think you could do that would make a bad impression?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Um, go to court drug
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would do it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Get another DUI in the meantime, that was not good either.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you want to avoid those behaviors for sure. you know, for sure you don't want to have sex? Would it be acceptable those things anyway?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, not really. I mean, I think I should avoid does not drunk driving enough. Or maybe not during the day of my court date,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): would you appreciate those skulls avoiding those situations I go in the court truck
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Goals that you could get behind
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I can try I guess to think about it and Charlie get out now I'm gonna be stressed out ate my court date. It's gonna be hard to not drink that day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Now
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this is really tough for you is the outcome. The marriage laws are important. Yeah, this whole this book, do you I think it's really encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed. Yeah. is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life with fat that is gonna change things
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know because I don't know any other way around it then dealing with it. I mean, if I don't go to court or anything that's a worn out for me I can't, I can't avoid this situation.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But if there's a condition of your treatment, the judge says no more drinking is no more marijuana period. We can see that that if you obey those rules or word, jail
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): now, I couldn't get to that. I know it possibly could probably well, but I was I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would think it almost certainly would have happened. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): back a couple of steps. How long have you been using the alcohol marijuana?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): For about like, six years, six years.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you ever until now with the DUI, have you ever envisioned stopping? Now, what's your plan? pre d? Why was your plan and all this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I had dinner the jerking kind of has gotten worse.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. without this or something you would have continued using?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I didn't really have any
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): until now. Yeah. Could this be a strange way an opportunity?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I guess if I had if I wanted to stop by this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): If you really wanted to stop because your stuff
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you could give a shot. You're not sure you could. You could do it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I've never tried to before I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's unknown.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): where do you want to go from here you have this to you, I imagine a hearing or some type of Coming up here to see me. What can I do to help you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Um,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a a place in terms of your thinking your mentality.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you want to work on that? Yeah. between now I'm gonna see you again. Do you have any hearings or anything coming up?

They do it for pain relief and feeling good. There is a little social component of drinking with friends during the weekends. The patient has been drinking and using marijuana for six years now. The patient hasn't really considered to stop using, but they feel they can if they intend to stop. The therapist offers to meet again since the court hearing is not for another few weeks.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hello Kathy, how are you today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I know when we spoke last time, you had some goals you want to talk about this time? You're ready to do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I need to Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What do you have in mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I keep thinking about you know, losing this weight and I really want to do it. I I can't get there and I don't know why. too frustrated. Its ridiculous
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): frustated Trying to lose the weight. Now you'd said before that you had a specific number of pounds of specific amount of weight to lose. You still have that in mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=2): I would 20 pounds 20 pounds. I mean, I would more but I, I've tried to do more in the past and I don't even get past couple of days. I can do 20 that would be great.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right, and you tried before? And what do you think got in the way?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): I don't know. I guess it wasn't convenient. You know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): something always gets in the way, you know, and then I lose focus. I'm not very good at staying focused on stuff that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Loss of focus. you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): And I forget and then I make you know, spaghetti casserole for six people and then I eat a lot of it and that's carbs and cheese and fat and then I, you know, will eat with my kids don't eat and then it's I forget that I'm supposed to be making healthy choices.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, you know, how to lose weight. And you know, you can lose weight. But your focus is a little off when you're trying and that's causing the problem. Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units? say, five pounds
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you think?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's something you can do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I am busy
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): for once a week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I probably do once a week
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You mentioned the loss of focus is one problem. How about motivation, you feel motivated to move through all those steps five pounds and five pounds and on.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): now, yes. I think I would need something to keep me going. You know, week to week,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a little bit of that something extra to help you stay motivated.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=2): Yeah. Like, when your kid does \their homework early, you can give them a special treat for dessert that helps, you know, keep it going.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. some sort of activity or item that you enjoy, that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say that the first five pounds
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I would love I mean, I've been embarrassed, you know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. Do you have the activity or item in mind? We could put in place as something you could reward yourself with?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): after the first five pounds?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, there's a few ways we could do it. We could do that. you reach five pounds. And then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day. If that day you're successful in eating the way you want, he would you think would motivate you more?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe something every day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yes, you know, each and every day as you're trying to lose weight. You're aware. When that day comes to close if you had a successful night, they were a less than successful day, right? If you have a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receiving items that we work out in advance that, you know, would motivate you.Right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=2): And that could be, you know, maybe watching a favorite TV show. Okay, you know, because I don't watch TV at night, because I'm busy cleaning up and everything. Maybe I could take some time for myself, because I did something good. You know, I watch a TV show.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): let's let's do that. On a day, you know, towards the evening. When you know, you have had a successful day and by what time would you know, in the evening?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Probably as I'm preparing dinner, if I prepare food dinner, or if I prepare fun food for my kids, but I don't eat it chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Let's say some Okay, say by 7pm at that point in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know, okay, at 7pm, you're aware. And at that point, if you have met your call, then you have a you have a TV show that you maybe it's recorded on a TV or something you would watch, okay? And if you were not as successful you would write. I'd be something to keep you motivated about the day because you really want to watch that show. Right? A lot of fun. Do you think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days it's process?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): I don't know honestly, but it would probably be the way now
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And this is something you could also track. Right? You could write down days that are successful days or lessons less than successful. And we could look at if there's any patterns, maybe weekends are harder, because they're easier or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or we're less motivated.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I didn't think about that. Because every day would be different.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. It would be good for me to stop and ask you what, what is your ethnic and racial background?

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, the next day I went to school at a note embed They staple it to show. when I got home, of course, my mother had to know, they went to parent teacher conference. And when we got there, I was the room. And when I got the gist of it, I told my parents how me being mixed race ways to learn or by having two different parents at the time could be a bad thing for me, because I went to a predominantly African American but he's obese something like, you know, apples and oranges don't mix. You know, Black Black Black History Month came around. And you know, you had a chance to pick some who wants to be a pick Harriet Tubman. No, and I was like, Oh, you're not black enough to be her and they had pictures on the wall. And look at her. She's black. You know what, when you put black paint on your face, and you don't always to be a slave and things that. it became up. I wasn;t hurt and it was I didn't understand that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And I'm sure none of it hurt at that point.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I do you think she's emotionally guarded. Um, I think she'll speak to that later in the session. You know, it says I think there have been injuries. Some of which I'm going to guess really are related to the the race pieces that she's experienced where she has felt judged under scrutiny and it keeps repeating herself and it's separate from competitors. Man accomplishments and there is a guardedness and there is a sensitivity and the guardedness is her way of protecting some of her vulnerability. Okay, let's move on to

You're all, you're all the same. All you guys are exactly the same.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): When you say,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You are all of you, all of you all therapy,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, I mean, I'm having a couple three reactions to what you're saying. I mean, one is that you're saying you're all the same and
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): we're all the same. You're all the same. In the for you guys. Nothing is working. Right. Nothing is working.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I mean, I'm feeling lumped in with everybody else now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=com] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, you are because you're all the same. Of course, you're lumped in with everybody. I'm not gonna single you out. Not gonna make you you know, single you out because you're not doing anything. You don't do anything. There's all this abstract metaphysical stuff and there's no concrete. This is the way to fix it. This is the goal. There's nothing what's the point?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I mean, it's there's something specific now that I could say or do that that would fill, give you what you're wanting or need.
Patient [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): How do I, how do you how do I go from point A to point B? How do I get better? How do I fix what's going on? I mean, that's the reason I came here. Right? I thought there was a reason I came here is to fix things. make things better.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you want sort of a, a kind of, sort of step by step description of
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): what something I need something to grab onto something to hold something Grab onto Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. See, my sense is that you know, that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to, to get to give you some sense of hope. And, and I really want to be able to, you know, to give you something but but it feels there's something about the kind of intensity of your, of your sort of demand or play now. Which, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need. Or, you know, a better way of putting it is, you know, have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us and there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation with Which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): the way I am I always come out that I always sway I get things. the only way I get that's the only way I know how to be. I come out one of two ways. I come out either full, full throttle, full, full tilt, come out and do it that way or I don't do anything at all. it's I one way and it's not good enough and on the other way and it's not good enough
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): it's
Patient [DialogueFunction=com] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): damned if you do damned if I do damned if I don't. If I go one way at everybody, it you know it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the Other and then if I'm quiet and you know, fall in with the crowd, it doesn't matter either.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it sounds it feels you only have two choices, that you can you can either approach the situation kind of on the attack, you know with with both guns blazing. It's a good way to describe
Patient [DialogueFunction=in] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it both guns blazing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): or or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way. Right. Right. Have those two which, which feels better, which feels worse?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, the bulk guns blazing always feels better because if I go at somebody with with, you know, full force and, you know, hit them over the head, you know, and and go at them. Even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter. Because I've already sent my face and when I say, but if I don't say anything, I sit back and don't do anything, then it gets me as angry as the full guns blazing. it they eats me up, but it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I blurt it all out and get it all out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right. Yeah, I can imagine that that right, if you end up you know, at least if you're going in there with with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met. Right. But somehow they're, you know, sort of giving in, it's you're giving away part of yourself in some way. So, I mean, you know, it seems to me that the you know, the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met now, right. You sort of desperately need Something right, but a middle ground. There's no middle ground. Okay. So, you know, I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is now. But I'm willing to work with you to, you know, to really work on discovering what that middle ground is. Does that does that seem worthwhile?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I have to have to find a middle ground.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, but what are you feeling now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it bothers me. I can't go one way or the other. It's like, try to do one thing. You can't do it and try to the other way. Can't do it. I'm stuck.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): There's a real kind of sadness there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Look at me. The sense of what's what's going on for us? It sounds as if here. You're asking for something. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I need something I can't get myself.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah, I, you know, I hear that I hear the, you know, you're sort of desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness. You know, when I'll do my best to help you

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): So, Felicity, I think that we've done a lot of good work today. And I'm delighted that you didn't have a panic attack last week. That's really impressive. And you seem really pleased about that as well. And so, you know, I think today we've run through a couple of more techniques that you can use to manage your anxiety. And it seems to me that you've got a good grip on those.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. Yeah, definitely. I think today was really helpful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Good. That's fantastic. Well, I guess if we wind up now, and then meet again, next week. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah. But um, did I did I tell you actually, that I had an argument with my mom on Thursday. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. It was a really, really big one. Yeah, I am. Yeah. I mean, what happened was that mom, mom, she was getting really angry at me for Dave again, because you know, we've been going out for three months and it's time I've told you before. Really, really, really doesn't him.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Ohh really?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. And she was, she had to go in for the drugs again. And then she was saying, you know that I can do much better. And she was just, you know, like, Oh, I really screaming at me and I had to take all of that and, you know, people were going around in circles in circles. And it was really, really not not very, not very good that I had listened to her saying that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I can imagine he has been really upset by that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I was because, you know, she. Well, you know, that I mean, I really Dave, I think that is really good. And, and, and, and I would, I would, I would, I would, I would to keep on seeing him but that she disapproves of him. And I find it really hard. It's proof of him.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes, I can see that really causes you more anxiety as that this is happening and yeah, you feel criticized by your mom and perhaps torn a bit between your mom's view and David? Yeah, I do. You talk to him.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): While she doesn't, she doesn't want me to talk to him. about it because she doesn't want him to know that she doesn't him. And then you know, he doesn't really her as well, because she thinks he thinks that she's a snob. And it's really hard. You know, I feel I'm sort of, sort of in the middle and in between the two of them. Yeah. But
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): felicity. I'm very pleased that you didn't have a panic attack last week. Yeah. And and are you. Yeah. And I'm hoping that the work that we did today, in looking at a couple more techniques of how you can manage the anxiety has been helpful to you.

Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All right. What did it do? I tell you that I had an argument with my mom on Thursday.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah, an argument with mom and it was really bad because she was yelling, yelling, yelling in your with about Dave. I've told you about Dave before because she doesn't Dave and she was having a got me for the drug. You know, cuz he takes the drugs and she was yelling at me because she doesn't that he takes the drugs, but the student doesn't understand that. I mean, I want to be with you. And but because she doesn't him see, you know, sister, she was yelling at me about that on Thursday,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can see that this is very upsetting for you. felicitated is an issue that you've raised before. I'm wondering whether we should decide that for next week, we'll start to discuss these issues that you're having with your mom that we can work out a plan when we've got our next session. How would that be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, this one, this one, I mean, the argument was, when she was saying she was saying to me that I should leave him. And she was saying, you know, that I could do a lot better and that I really shouldn't be with him. And I should leave she was saying, but you know, and then she wouldn't let me you know, because I wanted to talk to him about it, and she wouldn't let me talk to him about it. And because I really don't each other, I I'm really sort of stuck in the middle.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And I can see that that's a really big issue. I think we definitely will put this on a number one agenda for next week. Okay. And We'll work on a theme because this is clearly very important to you. Yeah. And I think that we're going to need a good chunk of time to be able to help you to resolve some of these issues with your mom. I can't How about during the week on? In addition to the other homework you have, you have to think about what the issues are that you would to raise with me next week about this.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. we can spend, we can spend most the next session talking about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It sounds that's going to be a very important thing to do, because I can see how distressed This makes you feel. Okay, ready?

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. we'll meet again, same time next week. Thanks Felicity.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, Felicity, before we start to talk about what you've come here to see me for today, I wanted to raise an issue with you. I think we both realized when you walked in here that we've seen each other before.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I'm Jake's mom. I've seen you at kindy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): That's right. That's right. We do run into each other, a fair bit at the kindergarten. I suppose what that brings up for me is that I'm a psychologist, and there is certain boundaries that I have to uphold with my clients. And I think that we need to talk about what we're going to do about this, that we we do see each other quite often and how we're going to manage that in terms of, you know, keeping those appropriate boundaries within therapy and outside the therapy room.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): how I say this, we have a few different options. The first one is that we could decide not to engage in therapy together. Given that, you know, there could be some issues when we see each other outside of therapy. Okay, how would that option sit for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, um, I guess, part of the problem for me is that I really, I feel that I really need to talk to someone about what's going on for me and I don't really, there's no one else in town I can talk to okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, psycho psychology services are quite limited in this area. Yeah. Okay. you really feel that you need the help and this is the only option that you've got. given that that's the case. How do you think we could manage this one we do run into each other outside of the therapy rooms that we don't cross over you know, the boundaries of therapists and clients. if I see you at the kindergarten shall we acknowledge each other and you know, keep walking or how would you to manage it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, I mean, I think I think it's good if you know if we can, say hi and stuff, but I mean, I probably Probably wouldn't want to talk to you at kindy about what we do here in case other people hear it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sure, sure. And I'm really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it's fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy. Yeah, yeah. I'm glad that you think that it that would not be appropriate.
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you wouldn't, you wouldn't tell anybody other moms, would you?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, no, I'm, I would definitely keep it confidential, that we're in a therapeutic relationship together. Nobody else needs to yet be aware of that. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): it's kind of like, we've got therapy for in here, but then out there. We're mums.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): That's exactly right. if we could keep it at you know, those things separate then I don't think we should run into any problems in therapy. Yeah, but perhaps we could check in from time to time to see you know, whether that It's becoming a problem for
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Do you think that sounds okay? Yep. All right. now that we've discussed that issue, yeah. Let's talk about why you've come in to talk to me today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=general) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Summary: The therapist had seen patient in kindergarten. Patient was there to take a therapy. Patient stated to a quick talk with therapist. There were very less therapist in the area. Patient befriend with therapist to say hi and stuff. Therapist said that the therapy was confidential and its between therapist and patient only.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hello, Sophia.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hi. How are you doing today?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm good. How are you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I saw you last time a week ago. And I know you've had some concerns with employment working on employment. The first before we get into that I wanted to check in and see how you're doing emotionally. I know from last week, on a scale of one to 10 you said you were suffering from depression at about seven. Yeah. How is it today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): It's been it's been up and down. I think today, it's probably a seven again. But you know, I've been back down to a nine lately. I guess maybe I feel a little better because I'm coming here. And I know, we'll get to talk about it a little bit. But I guess you know, last time we were talking about me trying to get a job and live full time job. And I think I realized last week that it's really hard for me to work full time now. You know, I'm doing the part time thing with the work program, and they want us to do volunteer work in the afternoon, if we haven't found a full time job by a certain week. And I just, you know, thinking about it, and I don't think I can do that. I don't think I can work for eight hours every day. It's too much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're having some concerns about full time work and that level of energy, you'd have to exert that commitment. Alright, we'll be today, if we kind of structured, what we're going to do sure for for this session. So, if it's with you, I'd to talk about that. Okay. All and and get some more details about kind of what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that. And we touched on this a little bit in the last session. But I'd to talk about kind of your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing some of these feelings of depression. Yeah. And then, for the last part, we'll work on we did before, interventions to try to help you with with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood. And we can make changes to this as needed. I want to start with an outline that we can, we can have going in okay. make sense. Okay. Anything you want to add or take away from that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No, I mean, that makes sense.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. So, tell me a little bit more about what's going on with the work.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Well, I mean, I don't really know why it is. I know I'm always tired because I I have much trouble sleeping, as I told you before. It's It doesn't matter how tired I am, I can't sleep, but it's I go, I go in the morning, you know, eight to noon, but then in the afternoon, it's like, it's hard to keep going on. It's such a long amount of time. And I feel like, I don't know if I can really do it. And especially in the winter, you know, if you work eight hours, by the time you get out of work, it's dark out and it makes my depression much worse.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, a lot of hard work day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): getting up in the morning and getting to work on time. You do with that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): It's hard. It's hard, but I feel I'm better at that. I'm better at it. I'm already up anyway. So, you know, I know I gotta get up. I gotta do what I have to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the work program you're in now, you work in the morning?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): What hours are you there?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Eight to noon.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And there's some work you have to do in the afternoon.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, yeah, since I've been there for what is it eight weeks. And I haven't found a job yet. They want us to volunteer in the afternoon and they find us our own place of volunteer. that's good. I don't have to find that myself. But I guess they want to get you used to doing something for eight hours a day and maybe you have something to put on your resume. And guess what? have a big gap in your resume that doesn't look good either. haven't been able to say a work tear even though I didn't make money. But thinking about it, it's exhausting. And you know, I get out of the work program and I think if I did go to, I can barely make it home. It's all I want to do is go home.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Thinking about it's exhausting. Can you tell me what type of thoughts you're having?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't think I can do it. Like, I don't think I'm the kind of person that can work eight hours a day. And it makes me feel what's the point like, I'm going to work eight hours a day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't think I can there's too many hours.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Summary: The patient had visited earlier regarding depression and was diagnosed. Therapist asked to rate the depression on a scale of 1 to 10. She gave the same answer 7 as earlier.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, can you think of another case you're working on another family different than the one that we've initially talked about? Where you've made a decision that seemed was fairly clear caught one you would have made before and yet you're, you're thinking about it replaying it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, I have this case. You know recently where it's a single dad, the mom passed away and I go in and check on him and his son, you You know, things are going well, but, you know, I think the dad has a hard time it's not it was before when the mom was there. Not that I wasn't there before that but you can tell that like, things are a little different. But you know, obviously, my decision is that things are going for the kid, you know, they're gonna he's gonna stay there. Dad is stable, but I worried like, is the dad under too much stress? Is he really taking care of the kid as good as you know, what if he's cleaning up the house and doing the things on there while I'm not there? You know, does he have the energy to take care of his kid? Or is everything really the way I it appears? Or is there more going on? I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. you're handling it to the best of your ability. But there's still these these thoughts that are coming out. Kind of encouraging you to second guess your judgment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Yeah. And it's like, I can't let it go. Like, I saw him two weeks ago. And I still wonder if I have other cases that. It's like, they're all running through my head. And I have these thoughts like, Did I do the thing? Can I do the thing?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Maybe what if, what if the worst happens?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): And I didn't see it. Like, what if something terrible happens? And I should have known better.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it speaks back to your competency as a professional again. that's, that seems to be court this. I think Here are several things you talk about seem to connect back to. Are you capable to be in this field? And should you be trusted?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): coming back to thinking there are errors and thinking that all people make. And when these errors become repetitive and you can kind of see them applied in more than one areas of his life. We refer to that as a cognitive distortion. Okay? It's not bad or good. It's how people think. It's patterns that people fall into. And there are several different cognitive distortions, there's several patterns that we kind of see. come up often in this work, as a counselor, wondering, in the situation where you're thinking, the worst possible outcome is unbearable, or likely or both. If you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that, to the exclusion of other evidence that suggests you've made a good decision. I see you're really focused on the negative outcome, the worst possible and maybe even unlikely outcome. And maybe not weighing all the evidence with the same weight, you're putting more weight on the negative pay, that kind of makes sense.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, I think that that's probably true. Because before I felt fine, and now I feel everything's falling apart and not that much has changed. And it kind of makes me think that that's probably what's going on, but I don't know how to change that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): This is frustrating for you. Yeah. The self doubt is worrying.
Summary: The patient has case from their work where they went and checked up on a single dad and their son. The patient fears what if something terrible happens despite everything looking fine. The patient doubt their professional capability to be in this field and can they be trusted. The therapist clarifies this is cognitive distortion. The patient feels everything is falling apart and not much has changed. The therapist adds that the self-doubt must be worrying to the patient.

So, you know, I was just, you know, doing my normal job making reports and everything that. And, you know, I made a report about this family that I felt, you know, maybe the children weren't getting quite What they needed, they seemed malnourished The house was really unclean.

<PrimaryTopic: Unknown> <SecondaryTopic: Unknown> <GlobalEmotion: -0.40>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): let's talk about this. those type of thoughts, I can't make a mistake or something that. We call this automatic thoughts. And we'll have plenty of time talk about the different structures in CBT. I do want to explain it to you but over the course of several sessions, let's take pieces of it for now. Okay. far we believe is that your beliefs combined with a situation and create these thoughts. you have this belief, you're laying in bed for work, and you have this belief that you're maybe not competent. And then the situation that combines with that is, it's time to go to work. the stress of No, it being time to get up and get ready to work. And then you have an automatic thought in that moment. Can now it's one tied to dread and fear. Let's try to identify an exact one for this example. let's use that scenario. You believe that you might not be confident you're laying in bed, and the alarm clock goes off. you're kind of pressured to make a decision about do I get ready for work or not? What's the thought then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): if I go to work I'm going to make a mistake,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if I go, I'm going to make a mistake. And then we talked about your reactions being late. Worry, anxiety. what we'd to do when we identify on that felt that is what's called self talk. And it first this may seem a little odd, right? you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image. But it's cognitive in nature. And I can't make a mistake, like, I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going to make a mistake. That's your thought. And the self talk. This is a rehearsed statement that you say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems odd The first time I do it. really, you're talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief. Okay? It first though it's going to seem quite foreign to you. Tell me how you how you're processing this now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, what am I supposed to say to myself?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's a good question. We'll work on that. And that's what we can do now. Let's take a look at some self talk. some adaptive responses they can build. I'm going to make a mistake. That's the automatic thought that's directly leading. Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time. Has there ever been times when you've had that thought? And you went to work on time still?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What was different about those times?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I guess I told myself, I have to get to work on time because if I don't, it's going to be even worse. If I make a mistake, and I'm late that it just, you know, it compounds and I guess I would tell myself, it's gonna be okay. You have to get through this day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, when you do that, in essence, you are applying self talk. Okay. All right. that's, that's really the same thing except you probably didn't have a label for it. And when you apply that it seems to work. the message you're kind of sending yourself now you're telling yourself is I'm going to make a mistake still. But if I'm late for work, I'll be worse. there's a little bit of positive and negative in here. self talk doesn't have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity. I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, that's pretty good self talk you have now let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=nan] (Sub_topic=Therapist gave a situation to the patient to understand how is their decision skills. The patient is anxious about making a decision to go or not to go to work.  Patient used to say that patient is going to make a mistake at work. Therapist understand the problem and explains its patients used to say negative about themselves that they are goingto make a mistake. This negative words makes anxious about decision. Therapist suggests a self-talk strategy to improve in reduce anxiousness. Therapist expain how to use a self-talk strategy in patients life.) (Emotion=0): Summary

<PrimaryTopic: Self doubt> <SecondaryTopic: Fear of making mistake> <GlobalEmotion: -0.24>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How many times have you gone to work and made a mistake?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=1): I don't know. I mean, I guess none technically none that have been something I've gotten trouble for anything that. Sometimes it's hard to tell because you know, you don't always hear from people afterwards. You can't really tell was it a mistake or not. But I guess none that it had any major consequences.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): none, but there might be a few small ones that you've never found out about. Less than a 10th of a percent days you come in probably very small, really, really small. The probability of a statement that you're making being true, is pretty low. The seventh thought rather, I'm going to make a mistake. Probably not supported by the evidence.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I guess that's true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful. I got a couple strikes against it. But it is the thought you're having let's deal with it. I'm going to make a mistake. what could you tell yourself as the first part of that adaptive response, which acknowledges that fear that's realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): I guess it Everybody makes mistakes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake today, but it's unlikely that that also be accurate. everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake, but it's probably not gonna happen. Rather than I'm going to make a mistake. you're going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while until you start to apply these adaptive responses. this is what we're working on is your response. everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake probably not going to happen. And will could be a next part, which is realistic, but also positive. That can help get you past the reaction of being late morning.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm a good caseworker and I need to do my job I can help other people and it's going to be okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, there's a few few elements in there. It's going to be okay, I need to do my The job I help people all those all those are true applying as you know even as you say this year with me as you say, it's gonna be I need to my shop. What are we having now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I mean it feels a little better but it's hard you know I felt still feel it's dangerous I might make a mistake but I guess it helps a little bit
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can you see yourself being able to in the moment and I realize this is difficult but in the moment of having that on that thought and that word come in. Can you see yourself applying this self talk?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, I think I probably will because now it will be hard to have those thoughts and not think of you . Okay, I need to calm myself down a little bit.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you've already used self talk on your own before even knew about these?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. It did help in the past.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): A lot of the corsage to some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training. Right, many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention correct decision. think of this kind of something you've learned in the training. This is a self talk. It's pre packaged, it's ready to go. You can even have it written down. Okay? Doesn't have to be short. It can be a paragraph, or more if you want as a matter of following the protocol. Once you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear. You're looking too quick to grab a moment in there. Apply this treatment strategy. Does that make sense? Sometimes it's likely Well, most of the time, I think you would you would be able to do this. Sometimes you probably won't as important in those moments to not get discouraged. Right. you can have a self talk for that to write something Dr. Crowley said it was likely that once a while I wouldn't build do this.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it's not gonna work every time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's the chaos of life, in the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere. the more times you have success, that that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptoms, but allow yourself failures. Well, it's what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts. There's not gonna be a perfect connection between that automatic thought and applied self talk. Okay, be easy on yourself as soon as you can,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that makes sense because like, if you could flip a switch you I would only have to have one therapy session.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It'd be good shape, right? it's a little more difficult than that. But overall, this these strategies are fairly straightforward. And you can definitely learn them and you can definitely do them. I want you to have that confidence. It's, it's normal to have mistakes occur. And to not always do it as you need to as you want to, but in the end, overall, you should be able to be able to apply them and It'll get easier in the future to develop your self talk for different thoughts. Okay?
Summary: The patient had fear of making mistakes. The patient fear to tell the mistake even he don't that is mistake or not. Therapist told patient about the self doubt the patient had like probability beign true is low in patient. Therapist asks some questions about patient condition while thoughts that he is going to make a mistake. The patient thinks everyone makes mistake. Therapist agreed to the statement but the thing is patient more likely to believe in it and patient thinks its going to be okay. Therapist said there are some elements are okay but still patient feels dangerous if he makes mistake. Therapist asked patient about self talk. Patient practice it to calm himself but doesn't find very helpful. Therapist suggest patient to stepback and follow the training for few days. Therapist told to keep a note not short like a paragraph and read it. Patient thinks its not gonna work everytime but therapist made him understand about this strategy to follow it.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you mentioned before that when you wake up in the morning, you you don't want to go to work, what's going through your mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I'm gonna have to, you know, hear what my coworkers have to say about what's going on. I might make another mistake. Who knows if I'm going to find out that something terrible happened to these kids when I go back to work? I guess a lot of stuff that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): looking into one I'm going to make a mistake. That kind of connects to what we were talking about before it says the uncertainty, you're not sure of your own skills and you're afraid of an error that's going to be costly. when you think that thought, I'm gonna make a mistake, this is when you're, when you're in bed before you start your day, and you have that thought, what happens then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I feel more anxious. You know, I think about like, what could happen to somebody else if I make a mistake, kids going to the wrong home or, you know, not being with their parents when their parents you know, we're not doing anything wrong. And I feel really overwhelmed and it gets hard to breathe and I want to go back to sleep and not have to face anything.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): there's emotional consequences. And then the behaviors. You don't want to get out of bed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): And then a lot more lately because I have trouble getting out of it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): When you're staying in bed, are you under more thoughts coming up?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this is really weighing on you. And he was edified these thoughts that seem to be connected with feelings that are unpleasant, and behaviors are unpleasant, but also maybe not useful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, they're keeping me from getting the work and stuff that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): we have a reference point for later on as we continue counseling. I'd to scale this problem maybe on a scale of one to 10, where 10 represents feelings that are nearly unbearable, right? And one not really a problem. How do you feel on that scale? Where do you rate yourself now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): now in this moment, probably a five. Around the middle. Yeah, I'm really stressed out but I not when I'm in bed, I can't get out of bed, that kind of thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How would you rate yourself when you're in bed before you go to work?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Probably an eight.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): an eight sometimes nine, now five, still not feeling great. Have you had to pick an emotion of standing out above the rest in anxiety, sadness, sense of dread. What would be the worst now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): now probably anxiety.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): five, on a scale 10 inside is really standing out more

Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, great. sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging, you said, sort of a sense of purpose.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And then the respect is really sort of all encompassing, not authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's great. All right. Well, one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends, What kinds of things do you to do when you get together with your friends?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, sometimes if you you know, go to the movies go to the beach, I said, or sometimes we get together at someone's house, play some board games and hang out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And when you're hanging out with friends, Is there ever alcohol involved.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, sometimes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay, can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, it's mostly for for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up, as they say,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. And when you go to parties, most of the time, there's alcohol there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'd say I'm on a not busy month, for instance, I'd say about like, two weekends out of the month to three.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): The days that we drink are mostly I said, they're parties. it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun and then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out playing board games, watching the movie.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohol is there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay? And do you notice a big difference? Or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at, say a party versus the night you're playing board games?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think of them as as different. I think, you know, night in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing. it's nice to have that kind of breather. Versus with a party. It's a lot more energetic. It's a after at all, it's very draining. Mm hmm. But in the moment, it's quite fun to dance and have fun.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, they're sort of pros and cons.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. What are the things that you about drinking or about alcohol?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed, and not really thinking about stresses or things that. But it can be when it's too much drinking it can be, can be obviously bad.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. sort of in the too much drinking or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things are not good things about alcohol?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): A lot of times, it'll make make people stupid. Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things that we usually try to be as safe about it as possible. we'll sleep over a friend's house. And, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks. But um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk and can be really stupid.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're trying to, you said, not engage in really dangerous activities.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You're trying to stay put you're not driving or trying to stay with people that you trust. But yeah, it sounds there's still some some things happening.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sometimes Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): can you tell me a little bit about that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I especially don't it whenever me or one of my friends we drink too much, and we have throwing up or things that. I don't. That's not fun.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, its not.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how often do you think that happens?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): For me that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drank. And it was, it was a lot. I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things. And kind of taking anything anyone gave me. That didn't end well. But after that, I haven't, but I do have friends that that still do sometimes. I'll end up having to take care of them or something and it kind of puts it down on my on my fun.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): huh. Okay, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are more relaxed, sort of carefree. Let loose a little bit more. On the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess. Planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then there can be some other consequences throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck. Your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drink too much. Okay, and the other not good things about the alcohol,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): people can get a little sloppy, I guess, they're all loose, like, with people and corners doing things that should be done in private.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That kind of stuff. you're kind of stuck being exposed to things.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, got it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. Well, you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I I you know, have an aunt who is an alcoholic. I, I see, the issues that are involved in I've seen movies and things I know that junk drives is an issue. I, you know, I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like, we can let loose but still be safe, someone's house or parents at home or something. But I I know that there are dangers involved. And I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): okay. It sounds kind of similar to your, your value of respect to on the one hand, you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start. If there's too much, then it sort of defeats the purpose.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines. How do you think that the drinking fits in with that ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): in terms of what, in terms of respect?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think, well, in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things And then that shouldn't be there. Okay. And then, but in terms of highways, I am respecting myself I am, I'm respecting myself by like, trying to stay in someone's house and trying to limit my drinking. I don't get to that blacked out that calling up and everything and try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior. I'm not going to go to some random person I may into I don't know where to do. I don't know what and things that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. you're sort of looking for that balance?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit, but not crossover. Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I usually will I start off by making sure that I make my own drink I know what's in it and how much isn't it that way I control how much I drink. I'll usually just, you know, get one of those. cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, Alright, this is my one drink, and I'm good. And that way, I still have something in my cup. people aren't going to be like, oh, here have some more like, No, I'm good. I have mine. And I'll still be, you know, having some to like, let loose a little.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And do you feel that's working pretty for you? Or do you sometimes exceed that limit? Or, or what do you think ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=1): for the most part, it works pretty well. Because I said, people, you know, if people come asking you trying to pressure me, I'll be like, No, I'm good. I have, you know, I still have some, like, I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything. But sometimes they'll be like, hey, let's take a shot and everyone's gathered around the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, Oh, well, maybe I can take one more. And that's when I start, you know, falling into, too much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a portion of the time it's working for you and another portion of the time you Maybe you, you'd to make some adjustments to make it a little smoother. Okay, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'd to make sure that I, you know, in terms of respecting myself, my body, I'd to, you know, try to drink less, okay, a, you know, it is nice to let loose and have fun, but I'd also it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body and I, my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like, 22. And, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): huh. kind of combined goals.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. you're you have a goal. It sounds cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal on on a scale of one to 10 Where one is not at all important. And 10 is it's the most important thing now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'd say about like, a six or seven. Oh, to work on it. But, you know, if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't. Hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, why'd you say six or seven rather than a four?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, because I still think it's, it's important. huh. I still you know, I said, I don't want my body try especially going to med school I know how things affect your body and also affect your, your social and your schoolwork and things that. I know that once I get to college, it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know, drinking every weekend and then like, trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam, like, I know, that's not that's not feasible. It's not a good idea.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, looking ahead. You can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself. Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to, I think on that same scale from one to 10
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think if I made the decision that I was going to for sure, then I think definitely a 10 I know I can.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=2): Oh, wow. Okay, why do you say 10?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. huh. making the decision in the first place.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay, and you mentioned, you know, quite a few reasons why you would to cut down. Have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, I'm thinking of maybe like, trying to convince my friends without sounding you know, dorky or something, be like, Hey, you know, let's stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or be like, Hey, I'm not like, I'm not gonna drink today. And then even if my friends do being with them, drinking around, not doing it and then then being with me, drinking, me not drinking and then doing whatever they want.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): sort of Trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol, and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking. Okay. Does that sound a goal you want to work on now or ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think I think it's, it's very feasible. I think it's possible.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities. I'm making some notes to myself and then maybe reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I think so. That's good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that sound something you'd to do?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yash
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know, it sounds you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school, and You know, becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician, you're really looking forward to doing in school you can get there. And it sounds you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol. And that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, you know, it really sounds to me you have a good plan in place. And as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, definitely. Yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff, and it's getting a little later, some people that drink drank too much, they start throwing up or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious. And that's not fun for anybody.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you've seen a lot of other kids Yeah, had some consequences and decided that's not for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I got it. I can understand that. Any other things that you can think of?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody. It's gotten to a serious accident. And it's very obnoxious thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is underage drinking is something that's not legal, and it is something that is considered pretty risky. I'm wondering what you think about that, in terms of how it fits into your life?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, I know, it's definitely risky. I mean, I guess we still do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): it's kind of something that it's there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah It's there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And I'm curious, you mentioned you know, your friends are important to you and your family's important in sort of fitting in is important to you, and how does alcohol play a role with that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, well, definitely not in my family life because my parents don't really condone, okay, alcohol use. But friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. from your family perspective, that Drinking is not something that fits very well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And with friends, you feel it's easier to to hang out with alcohol. Or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't you as much.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I guess it means this is there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): it ties in with the whole belonging.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward five years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It probably will have a very small role, if any, in my life considering I have big plans for my future.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school or in college or trying to get off school, things that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, the alcohol, something that might make it harder to reach your goals?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say when you get to college ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway. maybe one drink every once in a blue moon.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah definately
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): how might that go?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I mean, I guess now I would try to stop in high school. And once I get older, maybe like, socially once in a while, but not anything bigger.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel you could make some adjustments?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definately that's a good thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all important, not something you're thinking about. And 10 is the most important thing,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): maybe five or six.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And why did you say five or six rather than two or three?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Because it's not something I do not care about it all but it's not something that's constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. It is something you have thought about.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): I'm pretty confident that I can, considering that I'm not really an alcohol user, per se. I'm not really into that whole scene, it's gonna be difficult for me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what number do you think you'd say?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): On a scale of one to 10, If I can quit alchohol?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe an eight or nine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind. It sounds you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments and you're drinking at some point.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And it's moderately important to you. It's something you would to do because you have these big goals for yourself. And you feel very confident that you could be successful. With it, what sort of gold Do you think might be good to set for today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Um, probably to stop. Maybe next Friday I go to I have a drink at all.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Do you feel pretty confident that you could stop completely?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I can tell my friends, my parent, my friends aren't really that pressuring. It's outside people that don't really know that well. I could tell them, Hey, I don't feel having a drink today.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Definitely, I'll have like, all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): huh. Anything else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Um, health concerns? I guess I know, alcohol is bad for your health. that would be one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. it's, it sounds you're pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore, at least at the next party and seeing how it goes.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Do you think it would be if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if working out for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that would be okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right, great. And then it sounds some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Well, very good. Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): How would you advise me to get maybe my friends to stop drinking?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, that's a great question. a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking. And one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol. But of course, that's harder if you're not doing planning. some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. Some of the things that I would recommend, since you're interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it. Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something. It kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, for sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it? Have you thought about how you might approach with them? Or is that something else you'd some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I was planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That was me. Know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): your friends would be pretty comfortable with that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, that was my closest friends for sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else? I go?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No, I think okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. then, I said, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going. And then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Is that ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. Thanks much.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No problem

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. it was paper and pencil you seated in the room. Rooms relatively distraction free.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, everybody's quiet.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you're looking down at really the first item on the on the quiz and what's happening? What's happening that as you look down, you read that first item. What's happening at a thought we'll start a thought level What's happening? What are you thinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm thinking, I'm reading the question and I'm thinking my god, there's Okay, there's four. Okay? it's got to be it's got to be one of them. And I am not going to pick the one. I'm gonna think I pick the one and it's going to be the one that the second choices and I am not going to pick the one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, your thought is that you're going Gonna get, you're gonna select the wrong response, and therefore get that quiz item. Wrong.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How about behavior? Like, do you notice anything physically going on? As you're thinking about that quiz item and how you're going to get you call
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): to my palms are probably sweaty, I'm probably a little tense.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a little tense ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): Yeah. That's really is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it could be is that this thought of, I'm going to get this item wrong is leading to these uncomfortable feelings, the physical feelings. All right. what happens when you answer item one, you don't know if you have a or wrong immediately, because it's a paper and pencil. you answer item one and you move on to item two. What happens then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): starts all over again. I'm already well, I already got the first one wrong and now my I chances are higher getting this one wrong.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you it, because you because you thought that you got the first one wrong. That's your chances again a cycle on one wrong increase.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): If I get one to one wrong the whole test gonna to be wrong.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you ever had a quiz that you've taken where you were confident that you got the first item right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'm sure I have I can't remember any.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But eventually you're going to come to one item that your doubts about ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Inevitably it happens.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's gonna be one that's maybe a little more difficult or difficult for you. it seems what you're saying is that when you reach that item where you have that thought, from from that point on the next item is, is more difficult because you're having a similar thought Does that pattern continue?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): throughout test? Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): explain to me what like, let's go with the example, the first item like, because to keep it more simple. you have the first item. And that didn't work out for that thought, right? The second one your thought was, I have even greater chance of missing. what happens after you respond to that second item?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It compounds, I start I feel worse than worse as the quiz as I continue.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-3): That's awful. it's an awful feeling for me.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-3): Yeah right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): by the time you get to item five or six ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm convinced I'm, it's over. I've gotten to zero if it's Yeah, if isn't the first I've gotten to zero I've gotten a bad grade.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right. that's what's on your mind.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Uhh hmmm mm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how are those physical symptoms? Are they the same different or new symptoms ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): if it if it's, if it starts early at the beginning of the test? To my heart's pounding at this point, but I still have a sweaty palms. I'm still like, tensing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): it really gets mentally and physically more unpleasant for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Mm hmm. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when you when you're saying panic, the panics really occurring a few items in after you have the first one that you thought you've missed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Mm hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And this has been happening for a while, as you described, right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, how about your grades? How have you been doing on the quizzes?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I've been a pretty solid B student.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): hmm.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): and I feel I wish I did better. I wish I got A's but I mean, these are fine. But when I take this because it's not it doesn't. I don't know how it translates.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): About your study habits if you consider yourself effective and studying ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I've tried I've taken workshops on studying I've, I, I think I'm pretty effective at studying I've found what doesn't work. So, I try to study by reading the chapter is taking outlines reviewing flashcards, which has, I think the best results but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Okay, your study habits are good. And your quiz scores are good. But you're still having these distressing thoughts and these uncomfortable physical sensations when you take the quizzes?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Is that about right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, that's absolutely right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): really, you don't necessarily need your performance to change. You you need to your thoughts and feelings and behaviors to change. Yeah. how you how you're reacting to the quizzes maybe.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, cuz I get B's I said Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And B is good.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Alright, I want to take you back to the moment when you're looking at the first slide. Let's go back to that for a second. Okay. you're taking a quiz. And you're having those thoughts surrounding the first item, which will not mistaken the automatic thought we talked about this with cognitive behavioral therapy. Go on Mac thought is that I'm, I'm not going to get this one right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): or something to that effect ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What does that mean to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): It means once I don't get that, right, I'm not Getting in anything else, right,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): with that thought means to you is that you're going to miss that item and then you're going to miss all the rest of it. you're, you're going to fail the whole quick whole thing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): looking at that, almost, let's call that an intermediate belief, right? It's more of a rule or an expectation, right? What does that mean to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): It gets worse. If I fail the quiz, then I'm like, my god, I'm gonna fail the panel, I am going to fail the course and that's gonna affect my GPA.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): keep stacking other other beliefs. you're gonna fail the course. And we're gonna fail the final rather than then the course. a few failed the course. What does that mean to you ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): not going to graduate.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You're not going to graduate ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): we've moved from failing the quiz if we look at the meaning, right? To fail on the final to fail on the course, and now to not graduating. if you didn't graduate, what would that mean to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I can't I can't be a teacher. I can't do what I want to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your chosen location to be a teacher would be not possible.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. we go a step further and say, What would it mean to you if you couldn't be a teacher?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I don't know who I'd be at that point. That's what I always saw as my career. I don't know what my future would look at that point. Without that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you were to phrase it, and kind of think back as we to the CBT techniques and the kind of conceptualization uncovered. If you're to phrase as an if statement. What would you? What would you be if you couldn't be a teacher? what that make you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I am a person who didn't make it. I'm a person that failed. we said earlier.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm a person who didn't make it. I'm a person who failed. in a way, you're saying, I'm a failure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Is that close?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, Its fine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): remember, we talked before about core beliefs, and how these core beliefs drive these intermediate beliefs which combined with situations in your case, taking quizzes to form these automatic thoughts.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): one of your core beliefs may be that, that you're a failure. You may believe that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that seem something that you've said to yourself before or thought before?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): And think about it that until we did the step up to it now, but I, I can relate to that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Mmm
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Because a lot of times, I do feel like, Oh, I'm not gonna be able to do this. Because it's me, I won't be able to do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Not because it's challenging or difficult, but something to do with you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. that's what I call the you're personalizing ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're saying to yourself, at a variety of levels. I'm going to be unsuccessful? I'm going to....doe that make sense.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you think that's what's happening?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): It must be because I said, I study I got good grades. I've been tested years ago, I don't have ADHD anything intrinsic that would prohibit me
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're able to focus and calm.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): well,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): yes, I can do all of that. But when it comes to it, I'm like, I can't do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, somewhere, somewhere is this dis core belief? And it's possible that it has something to do with you believing that you are a failure. unsuccessful?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I don't think they would see the connection. I think it would be like, well, you do in school, I don't understand.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): they wouldn't believe that you're a failure ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you may believe it ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I guess, Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And similarly, if you had a classmate that was in the same situation, and and you know, struggled with these disturbing thoughts and feelings and behaviors during quizzes, how would you evaluate them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): I guess I'd say the same thing that my family would say you're gonna look at the evidence, you're not a failure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And you evaluate that they weren't a failure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But If it was yourself. You're being a little more harsh.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Which isn't uncommon.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): So, there's a few levels at which I think we can go after this. What I'll call a problem, but really, it's a series of thoughts and beliefs. Okay. The first is that the comic at the ground level, and that's when you are taking the quiz. And you have that automatic thought that says, I'm going to miss this item.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm not going to get it right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Yes, I'm not gonna get it right. that's your thought, I'm not going to get it right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Ahmm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And these situations, I to encourage clients to apply what's called an adaptive response or self talk. it's a it's a noun. If you're in a quiz in a quiet classroom, it wouldn't be self taught.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But it's a thought that you were consciously applying. the other thought that's automatic,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that pops in your head, right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): This one would be one that you deliberately think
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): and make myself.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what could you think to yourself that would be a counter to that automatic thought that you're having, that you're gonna get that item wrong ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): I guess that in my past quizzes like, chances are I, I have a good chance of getting it right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, looking at the probabilities based on your past performance, even though I'm thinking I'm going to get it wrong
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Chances are, I'm going to get it wrong,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right. Somehow I still have a B so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you are getting most of them. Right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Right. I have a good chance.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I that adaptive response. Right. Do you think that makes sense for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think you did well, there. the next time you're taking a quiz I want you to apply that adaptiv response.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that this takes work. Right. this automatic thoughts gonna come upon you. And then before you know it, you're gonna have that feeling.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): physical symptoms.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Discuss the sweaty palms. Right. And the feeling of I think you mentioned
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): don't let it discourage you those symptoms Come on quickly.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. There is an intervening thought and you've identified it. Right. So, you will have an opportunity, most likely to apply that automatic thought at some point. But the first few times it might be a little rough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, testing QA.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess the nice thing about a quiz is, I mean, how many items are on these quizzes?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 15
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have a few different chances to apply the adaptive responses. Right,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): right. It's more than one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. you know, you'd to get on the first time where you have that on I thought we identified on that thought, but if you don't No big deal. Right? So, you know, later on maybe it takes them two or three. And then you might remember, hey, I have this
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Oh, wait, supposed to be thinking that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And my hope is that as you apply this adaptive response more and more, you can reduce the probability that that automatic thoughts going to come in.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's one level that I want you to, to go after it. Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It does. I think I can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's how many feel you could you could do at the other level, I guess you'd call this a deeper level, but it's all really, you know, in your brain, right? It's this core belief.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And why use the word deeper is because we think of core beliefs as more stubborn, but they don't change as easily.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): as automatic thoughts might. I'd you to and this is really more selection, reflect on the evidence or evaluate the evidence that supports and refutes this idea that you were unsuccessful that you're a failure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. I think cognitively, you kind of understand that you're not. Right. But another sense, you feel you are right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): in a way cognitively you're
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): there's that discrepancy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right. Right. There's, there's a little bit of both.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you can tell me that, your family would say that's not the case. But you still
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): on paper, Technically, I would. I'm not. But I still, I guess, feel that way.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's a part of you that still feels that way. There's a part of you that still believes that cognitively. There's also a part of you that thinks through that says that's that's not accurate.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I want you to weigh the validity of that core belief.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. And actually, I think that this is helpful to write down evidence that that would support it. Right. And that's certainly something to note. But also, and this is really more important evidence that refutes it. evidence that runs counter,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): but record both, and we'll meet next time and we'll look at the evidence evaluated.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, we can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): those two, those two steps you feel you're comfortable with and they make sense to you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, they do. Yeah, I definitely think I can do those.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): When's the next time you'll be taking a quiz?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Think next week
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): next week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, I know how these quizzes oftehn?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. we'll set up a session for next week. Let's try to get towards after your next quiz.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): we'll have that to talk about. I think that's the next area to make. It sounds the next area. It'd be good to try and make progress.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Seems that's what you want to work on.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): We'll go from there. I'll set up an appointment for to have that quiz. Tried to adapt the response and try evaluating evidence. Quickly.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): does that sound good ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, I can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. I will set the appointment up and I appreciate you coming in and working through this.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=1): Yeah. Thank you much.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Remember before you've tried to stop living there a few times or, or last few months and with your roommate having it with your roommate being the one that gives it to you. It appears that temptation great for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, she really doesn't get it. She doesn't understand like, What? What a problem this is for me? She's definitely not supporting me or anything that. Yeah, God, maybe it would be better
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): living with my parents at my age, it feels a little bit humiliating a lot humiliating.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, humiliation would be one.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Yeah, this feeling of failure, embarrassment and then my mom is in my business.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): some clear disadvantages to move into Paris any advantages other than the obvious who would separate you from the Adderall?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Am I would you buy laundry? fully stocked fridge?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, my dad will fill my gas tank up.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): things that happened before ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): huh.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's some disadvantages to this plan, but there's some advantages. And there's a key advantage of being think of narrow.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. And it wouldn't necessarily have to be the rest of my life either. for now, to get me out of that apartment with the Drug. ?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): my god, do I want to I mean, that that's it. Like, it's like, it sounds really good until I really think about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When you really think about it, what comes to mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Oh, I start to shake that feeling of, you know, when you really want something, you really want something and you can't get to it. And that desperation that I'm like, now, I know that, you know, I'm living there, it could be my choice. I could take it, or I could not take it. You know, but at least when I want it, it's there. If I move out, I'm making that decision for myself.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's right. It would be.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is it tough?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Before it seemed you're really more on the side of making this change than not. Clearly, there's still some things you want to consider.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): No, you know, you're right, though. I want out, and it's not really a choice when I'm there. I say, I have the choice yes or no, but the choice is always Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You always end up using the Adderall ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, make sure I understand the situation overall. You live with your roommate, she has that role and she makes it available to, you use it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You've tried to stop that behavior, but that's not working for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, that's clear. And I don't want to be using it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't want to be using it. But yet you are. Especially because the proximity, right, cuz you're there and she has it and it's tougher to stop that behavior. There's another possible decision, which is moving back home, which has some disadvantages and advantages.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's true. It would be nice having that fully stocked fridge.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that there's an upside to it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That would be beyond not using the drug which would which fit itself It'd be a big victory for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And my mom would be there to talk to Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): let's do this. It seems that's the direction you're moving. Right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No pun intended with moving. But that's, you're you, you're thinking that might be a better way to go?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, for the next session, let's plan out that and this wouldn't necessarily be doing anything. This would be let's plan out the steps that you'd have to put in place to move out to move back home, talking to your parents, whatever financial arrangement, have the roommate, getting all your stuff out the logistics of moving, let's go through the steps.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And try to get a firm plan together. And of course, you can always re evaluate and change your mind.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But all we're doing at this point, is planning and seeing how it would look.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): This is kind of exciting.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Exciting ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it definitely is. I can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I will see you and next week ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): and we'll pick up where we left off and we'll, we'll start with a planning and we'll see what happens with that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Cool. All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): What's going on with you and your boss?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Ah, that's not even between me and my bosses. I'm a good worker at my job. I get everything done on time, but they're calling me inflexible and perfectionist.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I've had several coworkers. There was a recent incident where somebody wanted to change days with me, but I told them the schedules that I'm supposed to be here on Wednesday. You can't change it. That's the it's there a white. I work Wednesday, you can't change that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, they wanted to change. And I really don't agree with that. If they needed a certain day off, they need to go through the order of command and ask for a day off.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And they didn't do that. Instead, they asked us which day
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): and then they called me inflexible because I got upset about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): In what ways you get upset?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, I told them, I said that irresponsible that they didn't think ahead that they wanted to change with me. I am there at a certain time. I'm there from eight in the morning till five in the afternoon. I take my lunch at 12 o'clock. That is my Wednesday. That's always been my Wednesday. I don't know why they want to upset that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, that upsets you. And that upset them that whole incident? Yes. Anything else that your boss may have as a reason for
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): they call me a perfectionist because I the things done by the book, which I think makes me a great worker, because I get everything done. You know, on deadlines, not before, not after, on the deadline. And everything is exactly, you know, everything's filed. Everything's organized. And some people to, you know, take a file online, you this to fill out a report and it's there. It's in the file. You can't touch it, you can't move it. That's where it needs to be.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you need to self fairly organized as employee.

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How many days in the last say, three months? Have you been late left early?

I leave for work at seven. I get there at eight. Every, the whole day has a schedule. And I meet that schedule. And it's the best thing for me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): this is this is frustrating for you that your coworkers can understand where you're coming from.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't get it. You know, I'm doing everything by the book by the Vols. And I'm in trouble somehow. Something's wrong with me because I do it I do it the way. And that's wrong somehow, and I don't get it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you ever had to work in a, a group team with any of your coworkers?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): They've made me but I don't it. Because I know the way we need to do things. If we're given a project, okay? It starts with A, B, C, D, and then no, everybody wants Oh, let's do c o, d, and then F. No, no, no, no, A, B, C, D, there is no deviation from that. And then they get mad at me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, working in groups hasn't worked out too for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Not really, not less. People listen to me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): in instances where people listen to how have things worked out,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): if I oversee everything, I still get on uncomfortable because, you know, they're out of my sight. I don't know what they're doing. Sometimes, you know, I have to watch person, you know, one person, other persons over there. I don't know what they're doing. And if it's not done, right, it's not done right. And that's bad.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Can you tell me anything about Sure. mood in general, in terms of Have you felt sad or anxious or anything that recently?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No particular I get, I guess I feel anxious sometimes when things aren't going the way they need to go. Because then it puts off the whole day. And that does, I guess I would, I would consider that, you know, anxiety because if it's not going the way, one thing goes wrong, the whole day is thrown off. And then now I have to deal with that. Now I have to adjust my whole schedule, environment, and that has caused me anxiety, even by men, even by a minute
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you're, if your day is not going the way you planned for it to go, you're feeling some anxiety from that. Absolutely. No. Does your employer ever have like, unscheduled meetings or anything that that happens
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that he does, he will schedule some, some unscheduled meetings. And I've, I've commonly I've tried to call me approach him and say, you know, there's a meeting, we need to know about it. You know, I need to schedule my day around the meeting. He wants scheduled meeting at 1220. And I told him, I'm at lunch 12 to 1230. Why do you think that's appropriate? I mean, sometimes I feel I'm the only smart person there and the only person who knows how this needs to run.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): She has some different stressors at work.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I presume sort of my home burying meat, you know, if you go into my home, everything's nice. Everything's where it needs to be. I have my meals scheduled out, I have a nice little calendar. Everything's, you know, planned, you know, Thursday's chicken Fridays, tamales and on and forth.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your home life's a bit your work life in terms of being organized.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's the way to do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you ever in terms of your home life ever collect anything?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do keep them in your home.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): receipts receipts? it says to keep it. I mean, I've always known you have to keep receipts. You don't know when you're ever going to have to prove that you purchase something or when you have to return something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): what percentage of the receipts that you're given Do you think that you keep all of them
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): every single one I get very upset if I don't me if I go to McDonald's, or food fast food place, I want everything. I'm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): gonna ask you some some questions. Boom, come back to work, kind of regarding your work schedule.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you ever found yourself in a situation where touching something repeatedly a doorknob or operating a light switch? Seems to lower your anxiety repeatedly doing that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Not at all. Now that seems a waste of time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's that'd be inefficient.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, there's no need to do that. How about
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): double checking, for example, light switches or to make sure the doors are locked. I made
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): sure my doors are locked. The first time Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): check but the one time
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I do it. Well, you know, when I come in the door, lock the door. That's it. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what do you think the solution here is your your employer sent you in for counseling. the change,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): he wants me to be more flexible to not get as upset if there is an unscheduled meeting, if somebody says switch shifts with me. I don't really understand it, but I'm in trouble at work. I have to look into what
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you your job.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I do my job. I being able to have everything I need, you know, somebody calls for something, you know, oh, it's here. Somebody call somebody else here. I love it. It's a machine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right? you your job you how you able to be organized there. But there's some conflict with co workers and your boss you want to you want to try to work that out.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess I mean, I don't want to lose my job. And if this is a problem, the thing to do would be to come speak to you
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): not to open to attending counseling sessions and take a look at what's going on here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Absolutely, if my boss requires that my boss requires that then that's the thing to do.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): what was going on ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, it might be a little worse had you know, I've been talking about my problems with the perks. The past couple of times I've seen you and I don't know I think at work, they might be starting to notice a little bit.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): They might be starting to notice that you're under the influence of the Percocet?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Could before I remember when we talked, it seemed you felt safe in that No one was gonna find you out.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, yeah, because when I take them, I feel normal. Like, it makes me feel I can function. And I feel normal. But like, definitely last week, my coworker in the cubicle across the way was she was looking at me, she was looking at me really funny and, and then also, I've been having a little bit of trouble with the numbers. I'm not. I'm not on my game the way I used to be. And I know that there is a connection to the drugs.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in terms of concentrating, focusing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): yeah, yeah, definitely. It's hard to focus but if I don't do it I don't know. I mean, I can barely get out of bed. I can I don't know, I'm completely what to do
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And this is tough for you. The Percocet makes you feel normal. I would talk about this before. Yeah, it used to give you high, but not anymore.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No, right. It is not fun.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But it makes you feel normal.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And we've talked about the detox options.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-2): god no.no no no,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's not something that you want. really, what's changed to make things more difficult is that you're worried that your coworkers are on to you. Right. And it's your performance in terms of focusing on on your accounting work has been compromised as well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): is that ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah. And when you put it that way, she's definitely noticed it and she talks to it's not she's if she thinks something's up. With me, she's going to keep it to herself. that would be the reputation piece and then also, the quality of my work. I know it's, it's not the same, it's a lot harder for me to produce what I used to.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you're afraid that's going to be noticed as well?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, for sure. But I can't take detox, there's it's not an option.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright. Let's talk about I want to do some scaling work. I want to talk about the importance of this change to you know, cuz we've been talking about this change for a while
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that change, giving up the Percocet.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Let's talk about, let's talk about the importance of it though. focus on that one narrow piece. Okay, we're we're talking about how important it is. on a scale of one to 10, with one being not important at all, and 10 being extremely important. How important is it to you that you that you can make this change? Can you make this change?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): See, I go back and forth. I don't know that it's that important. Well, if I lose my job, that would be horrible. maybe it is pretty important. I mean, it's important that I keep my job. It's really important that I keep my job, and then it keeps my reputation.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, it's important that you keep your job and that importance, in a sense now appears to be tied to the importance of not using Percocet. They've been tied together a little bit, right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, because to get out of bed, yeah. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you if you if you had to pick a number one to 10, or 10 is extremely important. How important is it to you to make the change?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 7 8 7.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 7 fairly important.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, eight. I mean, I got to keep it up.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You have to keep it up?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): let's talk about another construct. That's important.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I want to talk about confidence. using that same scale, how confident are you that you can beat the Percocet?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): That's what I've been trying to do for how long have I been coming in here?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): About about six months now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I've tried I mean, I have really tried. I know I can't I don't I don't. I don't think I can do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it was in the one to 10 scale. What do you think you would be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): 0 1 I can't. I've been trying.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): very low confidence, nope really no confidence. You have no confidence. You have no confidence that you can change and it's very important to you that you do change. this is a real bind the trend.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, it's pretty depressing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You mentioned that one of the reasons your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six months and working with me and you've not been successful at stopping the Percocet use.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'll leave here swearing to myself. I'm done. You know that next week I'm going to come in and I'm going to tell you that I didn't use at all and then before, I'm in bed. I've already taken some you know that night.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's easy to see where the low confidence rating comes in. Based on your experiences the last six months. How about other times when you've been able to make a tough change? If you look through your, your past and different experiences, has there been any other occasions where you have been successful, beating something this and making a tough change?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, yeah, I mean, I used to I used to with the gambling I guess, I I used to hit Delaware Park, you know, on a regular basis and spent a lot of money and my husband was pretty upset about it and I had a really hard time stopping that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that was those tough that was. Would you say that you felt addicted to gambling?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-3): We yeah, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And it was painful to stop. Are you happy that you did stop?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Oh, God, I would never want to go back to that. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling, right, how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Yeah, that's that's a really good point. I didn't think that I was going to be able to say probably about a to two or three.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's some parallels here between what happened with the gambling and with what's happening now the Percocet.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I didn't think about it that way. I really didn't think I could do it then and it's been, you know, a couple years since I've even been in a casino.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you would say you were successful at beating that addiction?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-3): Yeah, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Definitely success, what happened?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): It's different. It's different. It's different. my god. Let's talk about that. I find myself popping them in my mouth. You know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the mechanism is different. for the gambling, you'd have to drive to the casino to drive Delaware Park.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You'd have to have money
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Whereas the the percocets easy. Yeah that you get them for my friends.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And it's a lot easier to consume and Percocet than to get in your car and make the time and the mechanism is different.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But wonder if there's any similarities with this? Well, with the success and the potential success, meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling, you think that you could never get through detox?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I didn't think about detox, but you're right. It was miserable in that period when I first stopped kind of casino and I felt that really strong urge to go. And I made it through that, my husband was amazing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You husband was supportive?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): yeah, he was really great. He would sit with me he would talk me through it. We go to movies sweet, you now he was really encouraging. Probably be really happy to see me stop using these Percocet too.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): as you reflect on your confidence, and this is not something you necessarily need to do now. It's probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past. All the circumstances were different.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you gained too high from that gambling.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that was it was addictive?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and and you beat it and it and it was hard it was challenging but you also have a supportive husband. Would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop Percocet?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Oh, yeah. Yeah. He He's really, you know, upset, by the way, and I'm taking them and he's really worried about me losing the job. I don't see why he wouldn't be able to help me in the same way, I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, since this since stopping is important to you, but your confidence is low. But this might be a good area to kind of process which is, you know, you do have the supports in place, and you have successfully defeated addiction before. it's something to consider, as you weigh, you know, I know that detox is something you've expressed really clearly that you're not a big fan of and I can appreciate your reasons. At the same time, get support, you don't lose your job. So, let's do this. Let's, between now and when I see you next, maybe reflect on some of the strengths and supports and the past successes you've had.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And see if we can accurately factor those into this equation. as you're processing through and and considering a very tough decision. it makes sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=1): I can definitely do that. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): we'll pick up next week there. And I really appreciate you coming in today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks a lot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks, you

I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you to sort out what what's going on and what if anything you'd to do differently. this is really up to you. What you would to explore today, how does that sound?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): That sounds really hard because I'm not sure I'm very good at sorting things out myself. Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on, and you're not even sure where to start.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's a good way to put it. I'm kind of confused about what to do next. And I have a little baby at home, I don't I can't think anyway, most the time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. now anything any kind of decisions you make, or anything that you do affects both you and and the baby.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. And, and my boyfriend affects him. Which is why I guess I guess I'm here to talk about him and me and the baby and what we're, you know, how we work together.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I don't know where to start. He and I had been together for about a year. And I got pregnant away and we had this baby a little while ago. And and before that I was working. And he and I, you know, we're on and off here and there, we get invites and he disappears for a while then he comes back. That's kind of what the ears look like. And I been getting more and more confused on what to do and recently he did something really that didn't even look him. He looked a different person and it freaked me out and freaked the baby out. And quite honestly, it freaked him out too. He didn't he said he didn't know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way and there have been Some incidents where you've had some arguments and then separated for a while and gotten back together but it does sound something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out. All all of you the baby and you and him and, and was kind of scary.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. Yeah, he came home. I was a friend come over a man friend, he doesn't me to have men friends came over to help me with my resume, because I'm starting to think about going back to work. And he had a weird look in his eye and I kind of, you know, we sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as after after he left he he kind of got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was different than anything that ever happened to me or us together and He got this weird kind of he was possessed by something. And he said he didn't, he would never do that again. He's he's really good daddy. And he really helps us out a lot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand, He's really good. Good with you and good with the Father. I mean, good with your child. And on the other hand, it was like, what is this something really different?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah. And he's, he's, he really helps us out. And I didn't know what to do with that. that's why it's, I guess that feeling that I have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What are your thoughts now about some of the options out there for you to do if, if anything, what are what are you thinking about?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I haven't talked anybody for for a year really
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): gotten pretty isolated ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah, I haven't my parents live pretty far away and, and I guess he's kind of a boyfriend kind ofI guess the words jealous. He really cares about us. And I haven't had a chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that will. What could I do, I used to work and I was kind of looking forward to working again. He's he's sort of made it clear that I don't need to work because he's going to take care of us he brings home diapers and gives us some money when he's around and we really don't need it most the time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and, and yet He, he doesn't really he's expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you. And, and when he's there, he does take care of you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it does take care of us. He's, uh, he's he makes sure that I have enough money for, you know, the basic needs in the house and he pays the rent and, and you know, but when I when he's gone and I run out of money, it kind of that's when I think cut it. wish I could take a little bit by myself. I not sure how to go about doing that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that leaves you in a real bind when you're, you're there and you don't have what you need?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): And I yeah, and I don't know who to talk to about that. I try to call him sometimes and make up you know, and say sorry for the fight that we had and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you've kind of find yourself when you're in that bind, trying to find ways of, of getting getting what you need.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how to do this. I mean, I don't know what to do next. Not very good at it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I want to say we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you. But I want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate how hard this is to be able to talk about it. And it's it's not an easy situation, and you're definitely not alone. And I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Thanks. It's really hard to
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah I know. There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are that that many women in very similar situations find themselves and things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you sort of sort out and Figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And and some of those that we work with are talking about the relationship, you've mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it's can be really good and, and then he can be gone for a while and sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that. We can certainly talk about resources about the resources in the community that may be there for you, or in terms of your own understanding. But also if you if you are in need of additional help, we can talk about those. We can talk about safety planning. I mean, one of the one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and in your baby safe. And we can talk about that. We can talk about finances. You mentioned that you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him now. We can certainly For that a little bit more, taking care of yourself which,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, for many, many new new moms that's hard under any circumstances to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy. that's certainly something we can talk about. And also the whole issue about taking care of your child and, and your, your mothering your parenting, how you might, how you might focus on that and in this situation, or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with up front. to start with, what do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, it's, it's funny as you're showing me this, I I've been thinking, all I've been doing is focusing on the baby and being a good mom and and, and yet, I'm also trying to think about getting a job and I don't know how those two fit together. And even as I'm saying that out loud. I'm not even talking about taking care of him. Which is weird that I'm not even when I look at this these circles I am looking at mothering and children and finances and that seems to be important yet I'm spent I spend much time thinking about him all the time and now I'm not
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with what what it means and where it is. And now you're kind of think well, maybe I think about some other things and see where I might go with those.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): These things if the job and taking learning how to be a better mother and might be a might help the relationship that might be
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): might be a way that focusing on how you might be able to take care of yourself get get a job or look at the possibility of doing that and the same time trying to incorporate you're taking care of your child that those things might help you um Free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What to do about the relationship? Yeah, what to do about the relationship? I'm not sure what to do with a relationship.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. You know, you're the only one that that really will know about that about the dealing with the relationship about what, when the timing is for any decision that you make one way or the other.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I don't even know what to think about that. I don't know how to. Yeah, I don't feel I've been making any decisions.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Well, and it sounds you'd to think about making some decisions in other areas. And, and when you think about that, is that right? Would you to focus a little bit on the possibility of getting a job? If that's something you'd to talk about?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And how to balance that with being a mom at the same time, because that sounds really hard.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work when after the baby was born, what what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that? And and in thinking about thinking about that, what have you thought about?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I guess I think initially that I would need his help more, he would need to help take care of the baby. He doesn't do that. Now. I don't know. And it be kind of scary that I don't know what that would look like. I would have to find some other help to get to be able to go to work even part time, I could get some childcare or something. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you might have to explore some other options for the child care and in other ways of taking care of the baby that you would be feel about going back to work?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. Yeah. Somebody I trusted. Yeah. And I'd have to figure out the timing of that and a job that would fit a schedule where I could still breastfeed and help her with her naps and make sure I'm there for bedtime and all those important times, but make enough money that it was worthwhile to, to do it. Yeah, to be out and working and paying somebody. That sounds a lot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It really does sound, though, you, you're really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things the basic needs and really taking care of your child at the same time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. It's very important to me. I didn't I didn't think I was I wanted to have children. And then we did so. I would him to be a daddy in that. Wow. as I was thinking about him not being around as the daddy and I'm not really sure what to do with that. But the baby the baby is the most important thing now.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I didn't realize that I've spent much time thinking about him all the time. And when we can hear back and does he love us? And why the heck did he do that that weird thing and why does he care about these other things that he cares about?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): being jealous, not wanting you to have friends?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, why does he. And it has nothing to do with what I'm thinking about now, which is the baby and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but it's, we've mentioned that a couple times now that it that it sort of surprises you, the way you're thinking about it in the way you're approaching it. you're recognizing we're seeing that you've spent a lot of time really agonizing over over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship or what it really means you've spent a lot of time there. That kind of surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): agonizing I guess that's what I've been doing. I feel I've been hoping and wishing and it seems all my focus is always when the baby's crying and I'm worrying about him and and and the baby crying is it's hard, but but if now talking about it letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing that I could think about why the baby's crying as opposed to why why is he not returning my calls? or Why did he give me that look, when I you know, talked about getting a job and things that it's not interesting.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're realizing to how much it really takes to focus attention on on the baby. And to be able to Do it and it's I it's hard to do both. It's hard to really think about doing both.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I need his help with that. Yeah, I don't need to be worrying about him too.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't understand what safety planning means.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, one of the things that we we look at is trying to help people who are in a situation similar to you where, where there might be some where there might be some fear about something that could that might happen, or you know, and I know you said he had indicated that he wouldn't do it again. But sometimes it really helps people to feel to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe, if that's what needs to happen.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): if he kind of got that weird look in his eye again, which I've seen before, but he never really did anything this before.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): He went farther this time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Okay, like, if I recognize if I saw that look What to do?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah. And, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know, there might be places that you can go to get saved, there might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe or make sure that the baby's safe for people to call or think things that you can do based on what your life is and what you what resources you have available to you. Is that something you're interested in really exploring?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Sounds kind of freaky to think that I would have to keep myself safe from somebody that says he loves me and you know, love the baby. Sounds a little strange.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Some ways it seems it shouldn't have to be that way.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, shouldn't have to be that way. But I didn't expect him to do what he did either. That kind of came out of nowhere
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): really took you by surprise. It's something that you're trying to figure out where, how does this fit and what it what does it mean? And what do I do with it? What what how do I how do I respond to this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, it doesn't seem real. I guess, thinking about thinking about that kind of makes sense ahead of time.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's it's pretty pain, you know, had a lot of pain in it. I've been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and kind of trying to keep busy and focus on things that are happening. I've been busy with my church duties and with my kids
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you even trying to stay fit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, it's been hard to think about myself when I have many other things that are more way more important than me to deal with.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How are your kids doing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): They're doing okay, you know, the little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when I first got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what was going to happen but the older the older kids have helped out quite a bit. I think they're pulling together.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Imagine that there's some you know, period of readjustment and healing and sadness or as in It sounds also trying to get things done.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah, I mean, my motto is to keep moving, you know, moving as fast as I can, trying to get, you know, keep the house clean and be good, you know, with my duties with my church and trying to keep the kids focused on their activities and not to be too focused on what's happening in me and Paul's life because you know, there's nothing they can do about that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. here, you're taking care of a lot of people, your community, your kids, all the while trying to take care of yourself. That's a lot.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you you have going on. Well, you know, last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe. And I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today? Or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, I, you know, I made time today to talk about this. I think it's really important to try to figure something out things got very out of hand there. And it's, it's, I'm looking forward to thinking about what what things I can do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, you were scared. It sounds you were scared.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): It was terrifying. I mean, we police were called, you know, we ended up having to call the police. And Paul was arrested and spent some time in jail. I had Child Welfare folks crawling all over my house and my mom was upset and neighbors were all being nosy and gossiping. And it's, it's it was very scary.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a lot of things were turned upside down. And when you say it was scary, I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): right? I mean, it was, you know, we had people come into the house calling and you know, checking in, are you okay? Or can you get a restraining order and my mom was trying to get me to move in with her and you know, it's too many, you know, too many cooks in the kitchen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing. '
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, yeah, I'm really I'm not I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna get a restraining order. I'm not gonna call the police. It's no he knows where I live.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): say more about that say more about why you why you don't want to call the police or you don't want to get a restraining order.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): They were they were throwing him on the ground. They were holding his arms behind his back and They have their guns and you know that kind of you never know what the police are going to do to a black man. You never know whether he's going to make it to the jail safely. I was I was terrified for him. And then the next day, you know, Child Welfare call in the house.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It sounds that was a very scary experience in moment for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Because I'm a good mom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And given that experience, you're it sounds you're part you're maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, no, no, I've told my mom that that's, you know, that's a last resort. And that I'm going to be meeting with some folks and thinking about other options.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that's what you'd to talk about today the alternatives to calling the police.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Absolutely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, what have you thought about far? What other ideas do you have about what you might do? In a serious moment where you're scared
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): For your your being and that of your kids ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I think I'm most afraid. You know that something might happen that will be really crazy and really out of control. And I've been thinking about what kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control. And I've thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it was came to my mind because he's somebody who we've talked to before.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, your minister, someone that you're thinking about talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship? What are your thoughts? What would you What would you say to your minister, what would you to tell your minister?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I'm really, I'm really interested in telling him more of the truth of what's happening in my relationship he doesn't know about He has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me. And then he's starting to kill himself and the children. He knows we've had some marital problems, some financial problems. He knows that Paul's had some drinking problems. there's some of that, but he doesn't know about him threatening to kill us or that he's been hitting me or his rages. I feel like, you know, that it's time to tell them, you know, tell him some of that stuff.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You feel you've been keeping some significant information from your what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things, what might be some advantages or reasons to do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): He's been helpful before, he's really helped us a lot. we've, we've had counseling with him over the last five years, numerous times. And he has been very helpful to someone that you trust someone that you have a relationship with, and he's been helpful in what ways is he been helpful? You know, I think Paul respects him as a man. And I think he cares about Paul. he's not you know, my mom and my dad and my friends. They they're they're really bordering on hating Paul. And they don't. I don't feel they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him that my pastor has some objectivity. And I think he cares about Paul,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it sounds your pastors able to see him as a whole, complicated human being in the same ways that that you do perhaps that there's this side of him that's scary and that you don't and then there's this other aspect of him that you, you really do appreciate. And you feel your pastor would likely be able to do that as well. What would be another reason to talk to your pastor, in addition to this being someone you trust, and that Paul might listen to what would be another
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I don't think that he's going to likely go storming into, you know, our pastor's house, Paul. That Paul won't You know, he's gonna he'll he comes back in at my mom's door and he goes, you know, storming over to my girlfriend's house. But he's not likely to do that. Yeah, I don't think you will.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): so. your pastor's home might be a physically safe place for you all to go?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right..to cool off
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Because things got out of control and crazy, you know, and and that's not going to happen again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you've said that a few times now that things got out of control and crazy. Tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that was?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): you know, you know, my eldest son got involved. My arm was was, was harmed and things were broken. He threatened to kill me and he threatened to kill all of us. And I had to call the police and I had to, you have people coming into my house, tromping through my house, grabbing Paul hurting him. You know, he called me from jail and how can you do this? You know, what have you done? You know, I felt what have I done? How can I do this?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. not only was it scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children, but afterwards, it was scary as well, because of all the things that
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): all that Fallout.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. so. going to your pastors talking to your pastor, possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantages. Are there any disadvantages, what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what's been going on in your relationship?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): that Paul will know, you know, if he finds out that I've talked to our minister about this? You know, I have no doubt how angry he will be.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this could really be a trigger a significant trigger?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yes, he finds out about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's a little bit of a difficult situation. Yeah. As you think about this particular part of a safety plan, on the one hand, there's potentially some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister. And at the same time, there's this possible significant risk. When you think about, you know, the pros and the cons in this situation, what do you what do you make of that? What do you Where do you go with that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): It's, it's a risk I'm willing to take, you know, I have thought about this. And it was, you know, things got out of control. And I feel it's time to do something different and to think about how we're going to do this differently.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You're, you're really concerned.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And a part of you is really worried about the next time. And you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning. And you also feel it's a risk that you're, you're willing to take given what is at stake. And really, it sounds you feel your life and your children's lives maybe at stake.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You know, I think that things can't continue the way that they are. I have to figure out something that's going to work for me and for my kids and for Paul.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Would it be with you if I offered a suggestion or a thought something to think about in terms of kids and safety planning is something that I know other moms in a similar situation similar to yours have done and that is, sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a safe person to either call or run to in the moment When things are if, if things get really crazy and out of hand, I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I think my oldest, my oldest son, that would be a really helpful thing for him because he wants to know what he can do. He wants to do something he's always jumping in. That's how I got hurt in the first place because he was jumping in. helping him identify something that he can do that will keep us safe and to keep him safe would would be a great idea.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, you you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violence situation, but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it without done.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, he's becoming a man now, too. He, he needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you, you're also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe. And I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would to do. And things that you feel you do have control over. Last time we talked to you, you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul, when he's in his fear and his rage and being violent. And what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control. You can't control him, but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to possibly a safe person, your minister.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and, and then the other pieces may be having a conversation with your oldest child, at least about who to call in the moment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And I confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any, any way that I can. And if it's at all helpful, I'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you I'd ppreciate that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks for your time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you.

And it's I know it's stuck with me I get I get excited when it's as as you
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): know, feeling it's exploiters. As soon as you're walking up to the wall as you're getting ready to pass this house Sumo to all the way to your girlfriend, you divert to kind of go to his house and you have this feeling of excitement. What's the thought that's going through your mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I I kind of, I can't wait for the for the next hit. Now I got passes how since my parents are giving me an ultimatum. And now it's kind of mixed because I'm like, man, if I if I get to do that, and somehow they find out like, it's, it's kind of all over for me. And then but on the other hand, I'm thinking about how How great it's gonna be. I'm kind of I'm planning in my mind how much I'm going to do and what kind of plans we'll have for the rest of the night.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you have a you have a few things going on. Do you think like, is your plan now to go into the detox?

I mean, my, my definite plan is to go into detox and if the detox works, like, I mean, I think I can be done with it. But it's I don't I don't know if the detox can work. And I mean, I've never only tried to cut back that one time. And I mean, I don't know how good I'll be at it. You know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): let's let's presume for a second that the detox would be successful and you you wouldn't be one even you wouldn't be on heroin coming out of detox.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Are you worried at that point that you'll go back?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't know if I'll go back. I think if I can get off at the detox work. with that said, Do I think I could stay off it, I think like, my, I think my cravings will still always be there. But now that it's like, now that I've come to the realization that some of the stuff that I can lose if I get caught, I mean, if I can get off it for good, I don't, I don't I feel back. It might be hard, if I run into my buddy or something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's that's the point of worry right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's there is a concern that you'll you could, you could go back if you run into them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): If you could stay away from him. You think you increase your chances of being successful?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, yeah, definitely. I won't there's there's many like, experiences in this house. That that kind of to feed into the anticipation and the cravings. I mean, if that doesn't happen, you probably help
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When you plans in terms of going into detox?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Pretty soon I think I'm supposed to go on Monday after the weekend. three days
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay. it it sounds what your parents have put in place you believe will work. Right? You have confidence that will work. And that your worry is what will you have is when you get out can you avoid it when your friends
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't buy from anybody else other than your friends.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's really becomes the maybe one of your key goals here since since your cake. Sounds you're committed to the detox part. and you know, some reading that incorrectly that that seems to be something you're
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): no Yeah, if it works, and then I can try.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's it's preparing for life after detox
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and avoiding wait for the phrase people places things through with with the addictions or, or substance use. in this case you need to avoid it would seem your friend we're and and where he lives which is unfortunately not far from you and in between because houses in between your house and your girlfriend
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): is there a way it's may seem a little odd but there's a way to walk around the block where you can completely avoid his house and still get to your girlfriend's house.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean there is this is kind of out of the way but I think yeah I could go there's a a horseshoe path. I could. Yeah, I could. I could go up the block and I'm around the horseshoe and then and then I can turn and get her house there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): She would never even see his house.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): have other options as well. there's that option. How about her coming over to where your parents that was that ever happened before?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, I mean, yeah, she's she's come over. maybe if like, maybe if I tell her that it'll, you know, help me out she can she can make that walk and I'll be like, it'll be easier
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): because she can walk by the house without problem,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I if I are walking out of the house, it'd be harder for me to do what I'm supposed to. if I can't even leave, and she comes at I might be best,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and to get to work, do you have to pass his house?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, no, I, I worked on the road. I drive I drive all the way out to the community.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's kind of some like, really, there's a physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here, which is physically keeping you away from having to go by his house and sounds the only reason other than to, to buy and use drugs is to see your girlfriend.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's an alternative strategy here, right? She She comes to you, or you could go all the way around, and then only round back to return. And to get back and forth to work. You don't have to go by his house at all.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I could do that. I'm gonna work.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is there ever a time where he comes to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm honestly not that much. Now. He obviously he doesn't. He doesn't really to leave his house much. He's he's kind of going on always there. that's kind of he deals out of there and then shoots up there. he, he stays in his house most of the time and he doesn't even come out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And we, you know, we know that there's on my thoughts, we've talked about this before, right, that is on Mac thoughts that lead to feelings and behaviors.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And can you identify a specific thought that may occur or maybe has occurred? Not really. walking by his house, but when you've been in your house this, maybe it's motivated you to go walk to his house,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): right. I'm bored.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): yeah, straight up. I mean, when when there's nothing to do in the house, my parents are gone. it's a it's the best way to have fun.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you've identified a thought that that directly connects to the behavior you want, which is on board. onboard leads to using the drug assuming because that would alleviate the boredom?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is there an adaptive response that you can put in there that you can interject at that moment? When you say, board? Is there a depth of response to couplets as soon as this post detox.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds that's your plan. You're sitting in your house detox is done. There's no more you know, we would hope withdrawal type symptoms
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): The thought comes upon you I'm bored. What's It's a self talk piece that could be interjected there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, I think if I if I remember to think what I don't want to do when I think that I'm bored, I kind of come up something else. I now my usually my two choices when I'm bored are either to go to my buddy's house, or go to my gril's houses, you know, across from my buddy. maybe that could be like, one of the times I called my girl and be like, Hey, can you come over? We can do something kind of distract me from from, like, wanting to go over dance place, you know?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to the adaptive responses, call you girlfriend.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): On board and, and she, you know, sounds what's voice that she's really supportive of?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, I mean, she wasn't too happy with me doing it she doesn't use I mean there's there's that social All, she'll be on board for that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It seems consequences motivates you. Right. And that's what brought you in today to practice anyway. I'm wondering if another adapter response response could involve, you know, I don't want any, any trouble. You know, and you can substitute a lot of words in for trouble. There's all kinds of trouble that can occur from using heroin,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): getting kicked out of house, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to get kicked out my house. I'm clean. And there's something else I can do here other than drugs,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm thinking in times and your girlfriend might not be around. Okay. Right. you still want to have you want to have adaptive response. That's not necessarily tied to a person in case she isn't around.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): can use that one certainly, that's a good one, when she's not around. And you kind of revisit those consequences, new adaptive response. Do you think that's going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I do. I mean I as of now, work scones good, school is going good. I don't, I really don't want any problems. And I think now If i don't realize that if I if I do keep using, it's not going to be something that I do when I'm bored or that I'm doing for fun it's going to turn into a problem that's going to kind of affects everything else. I think like, if I remember to tell myself, when I'm feeling bored if I remember to tell myself I don't, I don't want to be out in the streets and especially I don't want to lose my job. I think telling myself those things that will help remind me kind of what's at stake. You know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Good, good. it sounds you have some some adaptive responses to use. Nothing occurs to me is your parents around much
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, they're my dad works a lot. My mom's usually she works to a single part time job. she's usually home at night.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And night one of the times and you have gone over to your friend's house,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it's it's more during the day, it's more kind of day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving the house, but only when she's there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And similar to your father, you know, it's really, I guess we kind of narrow it down to when you're home alone and particularly when your girlfriend's not available, that's your highest risk time right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): we have the cognitive adaptive responses to come employment, what was anything more behavioral, we can do can you can you go somewhere else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I think one of the one of the other things I do to kind of clear my head as I to go for a drive. if I if I start feeling bored I think maybe if I get in my car And I said, all of that that's his stuff. I drive away, like, physically leave the temptation. And then from there, I can go to a bookstore or a comic book store I can, I could spend hours in there. maybe if I can, I can remind myself to drive away, go to the stores, and like, maybe I can kind of stay out there enough till either my girlfriend's home or my parents come home.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think that's a good I think it's a good plan. Yeah. and remember that the more we apply these adaptive responses, right, what we hope is that you the risk decreases, your craving decreases your motivation to stay clean increases
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): while it may be only convenient to drive someplace, every time no one's available, and you'd have thought that might not be something I do forever.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But that'll That'll minimize the risk for now. And we want to, we want to focus on the short term first. And then we'll worry more about the midterm and long term
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Then circumstances may change, maybe you he reside there forever. Maybe some of his work schedule change. Maybe there are other adaptations you can make.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But But for now, I think this would be a good way to go. keeping you away from the circumstance,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You definitely don't want,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): good news, a few behavioral pieces we have in here and then a few cognitive as well. I want to see in a couple of days before we go into detox
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that we can practice some of these adaptive responses are good practice some at home. Between now as well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right. Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and these behavioral responses as well. But we'll try to get them shored up before detox and I'll see it after you come out as well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): We'll make sure that we keep working on applying and refining his adaptive cognitive responses and his adaptive behavioral responses. Right. Does that sound a plan?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely. I think that will definitely help. Especially especially being in here and after detox. That would definitely, definitely be the best
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I appreciate you coming in Jesse, and I'll see you in a couple days.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right, Like, I know you have one in your office and people on their cell phone cameras.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): all the possibilities that I could be recorded. I've been very aware of them which makes me not want to go anywhere. I've been having Arguing with my husband a lot because he wants to go out to restaurants and I don't want to go because there could be cameras in the bathrooms and how I dress also as you can see him kind of dress more conservatively because I remember hearing once about cameras that people use on shoes that could be you, you know use in a creepy way and I I can't you know it's now almost summertime I can't dress and skirt or be comfortable because I'm dressing that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have covered a lot of ground there. you have the you have the feeling of being worried nervous, whether that's gonna happen to you. But you've also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change routine to feel safer.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I've um, you know, when I go into bathrooms I I've been looking for cameras to make sure they weren't there before you know me or my children that needs a bathroom. I have tried, I read online You can learn how to turn off the cameras on your phone, and that you can close your laptop in that way the camera will face down. So, and the same thing on a smart TV it doesn't recognize your face. I've I've tried to turn things off, they don't need to be on as far as people being able to access myown information
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and that seems reasonable. Once you take reasonable precautions to try to avoid being video recorded,

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): we've been talking about. Okay. So, really, if we think about, we talked before about the core beliefs, intermediate beliefs, and wonder if the intermediate belief, isn't it, I'm vulnerable. Or this more specifically, maybe it's more of a core belief. More specifically, I'm vulnerable in this area, put this guy on the loose
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you know, committed that crime. And then, you know, that's combining with situations that you encounter, and that's where you're getting those automatic thoughts. that sort of makes sense.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. you remember what, what in terms of kind of therapy, you'd to apply what we call the adaptive response or self talk. it's that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you're having an automatic thought, that's going to be to in this case, anxiety and worry and behaviors that are looking for the camera isn't maybe useful behavior, but leaving, you know, that's that that could certainly be on useful behavior. in terms of that self talk, let's let's work to develop a self talk response that you could tell yourself to that initial, you know, I wonder if there's a camera in this bathroom. Right? What do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and the feelings you're having?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I could say if when I walked in the bathroom?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): maybe I could say, you know, while there could be a chance that there's a camera in this bathroom, the chance of it happening is not very likely. And You know, I'm gonna take steps to keep myself safe, that I won't be in a vulnerable position such as looking for the camera.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But it's good. you have, you have a low probability of it happening, and you're taking useful behaviors to minimize your risk even further.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. that's a good automatic thought, I think are good adaptive response for the next thought rather. Why don't you Why don't you try that one out? Right, the next time. You had that on that thought? Right. Try out that. You know, I think that's really, you know, that's logical. I mean, it's, it's unlikely to happen. Of course, there's a chance. Right,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And we, we acknowledge that in the self talk, there's a chance that it could happen, but there's precautions you can take. That's a low chance sometimes as well, keep that on Mac thought. We'll review it In the end,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): before you leave today, we'll write these down. But that's that's one adaptive response rather that I want to write down for you. I also want to talk about like, the worst case scenario, because now you have the anxiety worry about an event that while it's unlikely it could happen. It could happen. And I'm wondering how you think you would react? If it is the worst did happen if you if you use the restroom, and you found out through law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had been, you know, watching you on recording. How would react to that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I think I would be really upset. I think I would feel vulnerable probably for a while and be hesitant. I mean, I would think ultimately, that would be okay. My friend is happened a while ago, she's starting to get to get over it and get back to her usual routine, although she's still hesitant, I think I would be okay. Eventually, although I'd be really upset that it happened.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And it would make sense to feel upset. But that would be upsetting for anybody. But as you noted, that would probably be relatively temporary.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): distress, right? Well, acute, and certainly, you wouldn't be happy about it. It shouldn't be happy about it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It would probably go away. I learned to adapt. How long have you been in the state of anxiety and worry?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Probably it happened two months, two months?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how many days and the average week are you affected by these feelings?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Every day,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): every day?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if we can compare it right, we have a chance to be recorded, illegally. That's a low probability event. It could happen. Probably not likely. The anxiety and worry that you're having. That's a high probability event because you're suffering from every day.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): And that's true. I never thought about it that way.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's a, there's a point at which maybe you reach and you say, I'd rather take that route to take the risk, I'd rather deal with the potential consequences of that an unlikely event to be recorded and face that if it happens, then be in the state of anxiety, worry
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): right, Because now I'm suffering every day.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now you're suffering, right? And if, if you could adaptively respond effectively, you you're still gonna have that risk of being recorded. But you know, you could survive that event if it happened late.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I can get it
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you're taking reasonable cautions and you know, things we talked about. So, as you think about this in a more general sense, is there a adaptive response, you could apply it to that, to that on that thought of, you know, I need to be worried about This or, you know, whatever that thought looks sometimes the thoughts in image rights may an image have been recorded, but whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are that are getting you anxious or worried before you even get out of the house. What adapter response? Could you apply there?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Maybe, you know, I said, I'm worried about all the cameras, maybe I could say, you know, I understand there's some cameras that, you know, use for good purposes, security,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): probably most are
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right. And the chances of being recorded illegally are not likely if, and I'm taking precautions to you know, go to the places. The good areas, good areas. it's not likely to happen overall. And me going outside the house is worth the risk. You know, the minimal risk that it would happen and if it did happen, I could survive.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's great. That's a great adaptive Yeah. And actually, that's kind of a few adaptive responses.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But that's good. And you can you can apply them and we'll, we'll kind of break them down.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I said, before you leave today, we'll break those down. you can, you could have written down as you go out. I think it's important, because the automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly. It's important to rehearse these adaptive responses. we're ready to go.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. And, and kind of, you know, we're being we're preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response. And in order to be prepared you, you have to know what it is. it's good to have it written down to kind of more or less commit to memory.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. So, before we leave today, I'll take care of that. And I want you to use as adaptive responses for this week. I'll see you next week. And record what the outcome Was every time you're able to apply the response, and that includes what you felt and what you did.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And of course, as you mentioned, any physiological reactions your heart racing, underneath that, that's really that sub behavior. But note both a physiological behaviors and other behaviors.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Once you're consciously controlling, and then any feelings, okay? And we'll go through them. We'll go through each time use it one by one, they have a there are and kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how it's working. Okay. That's the plan.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I think that will be helpful
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): we'll go from there. And I appreciate you coming in today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you very much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hey Michelle, how are you doing today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I am kind of doing, I'm feeling a little bit stressed out
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): stressed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I feel I have a lot on my plate. I have this test that I have to take for work.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What kind of test?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): It's an aptitude test. It has math problems on it and scenarios in order for me to move up to the system manager position.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now, that's a job that you've been interested in for a while.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yes. Yes. I've been feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they scheduled for me to take the test. And I want and I got really overwhelmed. And I started I felt my heart was racing. I felt I wish my hands were shaking. And I really couldn't concentrate on the test. Even though the night before me and my friend that practice problems, and I knew all the answers with no proper like, I didn't miss any of the questions
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you know the material on this test pretty well?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But the feelings and that the physiological response to heart rate and sweating, that feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses they got in the way of you completing it, you were unable to complete it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, I wasn't able to complete it. And thankfully, they gave me a chance to come back. I told him I didn't feel well. they rescheduled now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety because I'm scared the same thing is gonna happe, when I go back.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you weren't you weren't feeling great about taking the test in the first place?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Today, the night before, I felt I know all the answers, but the minute I walked into the room, all of a sudden, all these fears kind of took over.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But did you know that was coming?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you did ?Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you had some anxiety in advance?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): or no, you did. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I had some anxiety the day before. But when I reviewed it with my friend, I'm like, Oh, I know the answers. I thought that would kind of push it down. But I think once I got there, it all came back up to the surface,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): erupt in that moment, and that prevented you. What do you think is leading to this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I've always kind of struggled with tests. I'm like, I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test, because I was really struggling in math. And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade. And I thought this test that I was ready for it, I had a tutor, and I felt really prepared for it. And then when I took it, I failed. And I was held back. And I feel like, you know, that was it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. And I felt I don't want to say but I did feel a failure at the time. Because I felt I really didn't know this. I don't know why I couldn't pass the test.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And since that this was third grade.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And since that bad testing experience. Have you had trouble with tests since?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yes, I always feel really anxious. I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from college. School went on to high school. But it's hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I know it, I may still fail the test anyway, maybe a repeat of what happened.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Alright, in third and third grade, you had a really bad testing experience. And as you move forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): no
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you've been able to adapt. You've been able to take them and still, pass them.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, sometimes I get an A.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's, that's good, right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is good. Yeah, it's good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): But this particular test, which is not for scorches for work, yeah, this one, this is more of a stumbling block for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You have any ideas as to what may what may be what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I think it's the fact that it's this promotion. it's the same thing. Like, if I fail, I'm being held back. And I feel it's, we live in that moment of being held back. And that, that that's a fear that I have that, um, that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it really that same feeling you've had in third grade. That's coming up with this test.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, I didn't put them together until now. But yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And the other test you take in throughout the rest of grade school in high school they didn't, they didn't have that same value attached to them.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Now because they didn't have all that pressure that it was either win win or lose, basically,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you could, you could take them again or take the course again or?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn't do good on that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you have you maybe had more options in school?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yes. Was it fail, you know, pass or fail?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Right, it's the, it's the pressure is the pressure of you need to get through this. And you don't have the safety nets that you had in school?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, if I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion, I would have to wait. I did not have to wait a certain amount of time. I think an ear before I could take it again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): this a lot of pressure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah it is
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): is there any time limit to this test for work?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Um, no, there isn't.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): There's no time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): How many Is it a, a multiple choice?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. And you seem like, you said, you said the night before with your friend.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You're really prepared for it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I have a few a few thoughts about this. One is I'm wondering you know, we've talked before about cognitive therapy core beliefs. I'm curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating. For you now with this with this test, this work test
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): that I could fail that if I fail I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the things that I try
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): something like, I am a failure or I'm bound to be a failure, I'm destined to be a failure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I would say I'm destined to be.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, destined to be failure. that, that, potentially, is a core belief. Right? That's, that's operating.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I mean, that's what scares me. That's, that's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test. And if I don't pass that, it's gonna have this domino effect of failure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it could be a core belief, but it's also seems you're still on that thought. as you get ready to take that test. You're thinking I'm destined to be a failure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you're having what sounds a panic response to heart racing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, my hands shaking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Are you in the room alone? You're taking the test?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you are. no one's really seeing you have this. I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet we haven't really gotten too far into it. But it sounds it has some panic features.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Because it's not. It's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the items. So, okay. one thought I have is you have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything this?, the third grade thing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get worked out when I'm about to take a test, okay, but it's only around test.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And what happens once you get worked up once your heart rate increases and You have any other physiological symptoms would
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): want to do take the test?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): hmmm
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Um, I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response. Right? So, which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk, I wonder if your doctor response couldn't be I can ride this out you have no time to test?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, the panic responses only maintained for long
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): and I could also choose maybe questions that are no the answer to automatically that could help maybe release some of that stress
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to get some in a sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like, answering those you know, you're closer to achieving your goal
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): yes and then I feel I know, at least I know that like, Don't validate the feeling that I maybe I can pass this test.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the more items you you answer correctly, the less anxious you're gonna feel because you're closer to the end of.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, definitely. Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that I know these questions are definitely going to be right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's that's one well, that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right? you can you can wait out the panic. I mean, you're in the room alone.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, that's true. Nobody's there. Nobody's gonna see me. I'm kind of trying to get myself together.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Now the panic painful. Right, the you know, the panic symptoms are painful. what you could tell yourself is, this isn't pleasant. But I can write out these symptoms because they only last long.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Probabiy, I could use self talk.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Exactly. Yeah, because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know, five minutes. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But you have no time limit?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah if you can kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, you could get right. And kind of, at the same time be telling yourself I can ride this out.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I've done that in the past, I can apply it to this test.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if that's worked for you that ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): yes, that has worked and I passed.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that's, that's certainly that's certainly one adaptive response to try writing. Another one could be that, although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year. Right. You could try it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I mean, I know that's not what you want, but, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that's not working. Right. The I'm I'm Destin, that was the word I'm destined to be a failure. We know that's not working for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): even if I have to take the test again and in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again. It's not I'll never be able to take this test again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, you have, you have another years of study, right? And, of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome, I know you don't want. But it's not the end of your career, It's not something drastic it's important to you and I can appreciate that. But it's not the end of your career. You're not going to be unemployed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): No, no, definitely not. And thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back. I still managed to, you know, do the next year and keep moving up. And it hasn't really, in the long run prevented me from doing anything that I've wanted to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): that's great. That's another adaptive response, which you've survived this before.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, I definitely have.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this one event, I mean, I had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you don't want that this kind of fashion. While use your word, your destiny by this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic symptoms. And fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again. And, and I met you know, you have I imagine you could you can write out these, these symptoms. And I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I've been successful this before.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. I mean, definitely I feel a lot better now because I know that no matter what happens, I've been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to that feeling that I'm going to fail together.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, it's good, when you have to take the test?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): on next week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): let's schedule one more appointment before that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And we'll, we'll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you're ready to go. Okay. And really will kind of focus on the positive outcome. Right. Okay, which is taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you're having, and fighting through the useful thoughts.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=1): Okay. Yeah, I mean, that sounds good. That helped me prepare for the test.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Great. So, Michelle, I'll see you. I'll see you then and work through it. I really appreciate you coming in today.
Summary: Patient is feeling a lot of anxiety when they actually scheduled for patient to take the test. Patient wasn't able to complete exam and they gave patient a chance to come back as patient didn't feel well. Patient had some anxiety in advance the day before. it is a lot of pressure and patient thinks he is bound to be a failure. Patient lives in room alone and hands shaking. Therapist doesn't call it panic attacks.

Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I will. Yeah, sometimes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): sometimes?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Um, I mean, you know, sometimes I know, It would be scary to try it and my husband would be hurt, but at the same time, I want to end this. I want to end the feeling that I'm having depression. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Do you have any plan as to how you would end your life if you decide to do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I know if I wanted to that we have pills in the cabinet. it wouldn't be that hard, I could take the bottle and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): same pills that you prescribed for depression?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you feel you're going to carry out that plan?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, I mean, part of it. That's why I'm nervous because like, I'm worried that I might, but at the same time, You know, I'm afraid to sometimes I think that I might and sometimes I think I won't. I don't want to but sometimes I get scared that I will.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Today you're a little worried that you will, or you're a little closer to it then than usual. We've talked about this before in the past, you've come in, you've had kind of that same plan to pills and the thoughts and what what stops you those times was stuck in the past.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): In the past, I thought, this will get better. I have to keep trying, I thought what will my husband feel when I'm gone and my family, my parents, my brother and sister I thought that this is as bad as it can get. It has to get better eventually. But now I'm starting to feel I don't think it's gonna get better.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, there's times before when you had the same feeling, right? You felt as bad as you feel now really down hopeless. What happened a few days after that, after the thoughts suicide went away. What was your outlook on life that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I feel I feel a little better. You know, and then I'd say to myself, that was silly, you know, I don't want to do that. I don't, I don't want to end things. You know. It's It's too rash. But you know, it's starting to feel a permanent problem.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you feel this time these suicidal thoughts are markedly different than what you've experienced before.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I wouldn't say markedly but I would say they're different. They're a little they're stronger,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): more intense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When you think about this, these feelings on before we talked about I know this relationship surrounding relationships, the same thing this time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I guess that has something to do with it, I guess. It's when I look to everything, everything that could be good or everything, everything life, my relationships, the future I look at it and I see despair. I see everything going wrong. And I don't see how it could get better. I don't see it
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in a sense of hopelessness?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this time is different because you feel it's very less situational, less tired of relationships and more, Well, philosophical, you're looking at your outlook and you're saying it's not gonna get any better. What's the point going on? this is a little bit new territory for you. How long we've been feeling this way with the intensity now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Probably a week, maybe a little less
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What was prevented you from hurting yourself those last week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'm afraid to do it. I'm scared. It's It's jumping off a diving board. you get up to the edge and you stand there, that's where that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you made any gestures to harm yourself? if you went and grabbed the pills or went to the medicine cabinet looks at the pills, anything that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Sometimes I look at them, look at them.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Don't think further than look at them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, I mean, I have to take them. It's my prescription. when it's time I start thinking about it. it's more I think about my like, the ideations come even more because it's a trigger I'm thinking about the pills. I go to the cabinet, and I get my pills and I and I take the, the one that I'm supposed to, but I look at the bottle and I kind of stand there and I think Instead of putting the bottle back, I could take it with me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what do you end up doing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): It takes a while but I put it back. It's It's scary. I look into the bottle and I'm afraid because dying is scary, but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and how about the pain that you would cause husband and the rest of your family?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I don't want to do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't want that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't. I don't. I don't want my husband to find me, I don't want him to feel this is his fault. I don't want him to be sad that I'm gone. I don't want him to feel I feel.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And when relatives of somebody that committed suicide, hear about the suicide? Who do they blame?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. It's not it's not their fault. And I know that they wouldn't be able to get over it and I know that they'll be thinking about how bad I felt they'll have to know what it really felt for me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know this is a tough time right? But the good news is you're here talking to me about it. Right? Now you're talking about it. I'm gonna guess that you want to do something for bad to feel better. Are you gonna carry out your plan or you're gonna hurt yourself?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't want to
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): are you going to?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, I think I think if I can remember what it'll be for them. That'll keep me from doing it. You know, it's the times that I forget to think about how they're going to feel that I get closer to the edge. But when I remember, you know, like, It upsets me to think about what it'll be for them. if I can remember to think about that and it'll help me not do that. But I think having the pills there in the cabinet that is a big temptation for me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, can we can we do this? Your husband's at home? Right. You mentioned you take two pills once a day?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Before for bed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can we would you be willing to sign a release I can talk to him. He can hold on to those pills. give you the pill each night take one and I will that be okay?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think I think that would be a good idea.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is there anything else in the medicine cabinet or anywhere else in the house to give you a danger to?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I think, I think yeah, I think it would be a good idea to make sure that everything that was in the medicine cabinet
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): all the tools?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Would he be willing to do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Right. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that he would be willing to do that. He doesn't. He wants me to get through this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. If I get release for the talk you might , sign it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Oh, I'll do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Are you familiar before, are you familiar with this concept we talked about before contracting for safety, or the prior time. So, you've been the state similar to this. Can you promise me that you're going to not hurting yourself.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I can Yeah, I can do that. At least until next week when we meet again, I promise.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Let's be a little certain that okay, sets up that for a more.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, yeah, we can definitely do that I can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know this is a rough time trying to appreciate how rough it is for you. I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before. Now you do tend to pull out of this. And you look back at a lot differently. But in the moment, it's hard to see that. That doesn't necessarily make this any easier. But if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression. You'll probably have a different outlook. If history is any evidence. Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. what do you have planned for us today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, you know, I'm gonna go home. My husband will be home. work and have dinner, watch TV.

Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, yeah, I'll probably be home for a little while in the morning, but I have to work I won't have, you know, I'll be busy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cv] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, if these feelings intensified, or you do feel you're gonna act on them, which promised to call me and kill me call 911
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I'll do that. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm gonna get that release you can talk to your husband. And then see it for a few minutes or point for more. All right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you notice that you're walking less since you've had a first impression. I
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): really haven't been doing too much of anything I've been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over doing getting homework done. Because I'm, you know, back in school, and it's been stressful and overwhelming. You know, I said, it's kind of gotten me in this little funk, this depressed mood.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): since you're on the topic of homework, which is something you think you can do there, you mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming. And that sounds the type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes. Mm hmm. Do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, because you know, is there's much work to be done and sometimes a good you know, several assignments. Do And at the same time, and I find myself rushing to get assignments and and, you know, it can be a little daunting. It's overwhelming sometimes. yeah. And I don't know, maybe if I spaced that out and, you know, took, you know, did some time management or something that I don't know, to kind of help me
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): feel maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, yeah, you're right. It sounds this is an organizational thing, right. if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier, and do it in small bits, okay. Instead of me waiting more or less the last minute, right. That would reduce the mean likely, I would think reduce some of the stressed feelings of being overwhelmed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm sure it would you sure would.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): one, make that your sec objective then you have the walking, okay. And then you'll have trying to space out the homework.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, that sounds doable
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): sound good. All right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What other objectives might work?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Let's see.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that worked in the past for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing. And now I feel I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because I've been busy doing work doing homework, I think that would probably help.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It has kind of come in the singing parts fun for it sounds but also there's a social component seems
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, it is. It is. Enjoy access to enjoy singing, and, you know, I enjoy the people that I was saying with and we will go and hang out together, go to different, you know, jazz clubs or events, you know, different bands that were playing it you know, it'll be nice. It's fun. I love music. I love listening to it and I love you know, singing. making music. that was great. I think that would be a good goal.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, it's I I love it. I enjoy doing it. And I haven't had a chance to deal with lightning.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): far. This is justmaking the time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, yeah. Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Good. All right. we'll make that the third objective. we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently. And then singing and that, that socializing, it's the companies that, that singing that's great. three objectives is good. I try to get to four. If you have one. Is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you've associated with not feeling depressed when
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt. And that's two things. The beach. I love the beach because it's soothing. It's company. And I, my, she's such an awesome person and she's always pouring into me and I love spending time with her. she lives down to pitch.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, she does. Okay, this seems a good, good objective to Yes. you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. Again, at home doing homework, and I haven't gone to visit her in a while. And the thing is, she only lives an hour away. it's not a it's not right. No, it's not. that's a, you know, a trip I couldn't do on a Saturday. Take a break and go down there and spend some time with that will be I think that will be helpful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): again, kind of kind of getting away from the school stressors. take taking a break from it for a day. Yes. And then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with. Good. Good. All right. I want to go through each one of these. And make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do, but these are all specific, which is good. Do you feel these are all achievable? These are things you can do. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, someone that knew done in the past, right,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): now we have the specific and the achievable. I don't want to get too personal and more tricky, which is making it measurable. I to do here. I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives. I want you to decide. But I want to see We can quantify, in some manner, how often you'll be able to do these different things or how, you know, quite a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but, but first with the walking. in a given week, say what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking? How many times?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Um, maybe I can start out with twice a week, twice quickly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Do you have two particular days in line days for your responsibilities aren't too great. You have that opportunity?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe we need to start with one day a week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Let's go one day, one time, one time a week. Let's talk with one and then we'll see what happens.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what day of the week are you thinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): About Monday?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Consider a window of opportunity you see on Monday.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It is. Yeah. Plus, it kind of, I think, no, no. How about Wednesday?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Wednesday?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. Wednesday, middle of the week. Stress from work and school and yes, Wednesday. Sounds good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Once you have a particular time range, you to walk a few times a day,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 6:30.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's a good time for you. As the time you can get out of house,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yes, off work. And give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door. Because if I, if I make it too late, I'm not going to go
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): 6:30 is kind of a good, that's a good time. Yeah. 630 good. we'll start with that objective. The Walking Every Wednesday at 630 for every amount of time are comfortable with. So, the homework is a little trickier, right? This is about spacing it out. Okay? the homework assignments, they're stressing you out. How much time did they take? Last few few questions. How much time do they take to complete? Generally? an hour?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): it depends on the assignment.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): If you had the average of
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): the average two hours
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): let's go to worst case, let's go two and a half hours to cover code worst case will generally be the worst case.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Maybe it depends, because
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): when we get three,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah, the second
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): two to three hours, okay. And then how much time do you have when it's assigned to when it's due usually
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Maybe a couple of weeks.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): A couple weeks. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I get distracted. a little distracted. it's, you know, I start reading and I'll fall asleep or I get distracted by something. And then before you know it, the time is gone. And I'm rushing at the end to get it shown up to try and get it all done.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I was ready to do the work to ease into the last Okay, yeah, I could see how that would be stressful. what day of the week isn't usually a Sunday.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): On Tuesdays on Tuesdays.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you have Tuesday, and then you have another Tuesday and the week after that, you have three hours of work. And those two weeks.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): shipping. Okay?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, will be the first day and time but kind of when you specified Wednesday 630 that's gonna be a walking time, at the time, and you can start the homework because the first time
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm come back from my walk on Wednesdays.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How long do you foresee
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, normally only half an hour.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to get some time to decompress and round Alright, from eight to nine on Tuesday, or Wednesday, on Wednesday, you'll get the first third of the homework. And then and then stop. Okay, that'd be that'd be done for the night. Okay. All right. That's some big plans. How about that second hour?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'll get started.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Thursday, it's one day apart.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's due Thursday.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, do come Thursday. Yeah. an hour. Yes. And what hour do you have in mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Thursday's
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but 7070 one night, Wednesday be at nine o'clock. And then on Thursday, seven nine was two hours. Seven days. Sorry. Okay. now the last hour remains
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sunday, Sunday
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): through Sunday. Okay. you you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night? Yeah, the rest of that time off. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Sure that's achievable. That seems you're, you're getting a lot in there, but you think you can do it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can try. Okay. Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that sounds good. All right. What time Sunday,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sunday around five
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to five to six, five to six.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of have to be on the high side, but if it did, I would be able to go five to seven that's kind of like, yeah, flexible time there. Yes. what would that feel to get your homework done?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But it would be a relief.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on Sunday, where you need more time, and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday after you walk bacon. Yeah. that could be your, your backup. Yes, that makes sense. Yes. Because you still have another six days to have done after that. Right. All right. all those seem realistic and achievable.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It does.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Every many Fridays.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): every friday
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, this is this isn't every Friday commitment. Right, this thing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. But one Friday is generally it's maybe
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): about two hours, two hours. two hours every Friday. There's something really enjoyed though. and it sounds you look forward to it. Yeah. Friday, two hours, I guess. Yes. afternoon or evening. Evening. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, if I if it was something that came up that I really had to get done is not I can't not go. it won't be managed, right?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Good. Okay. that was the last objective this is. This is I guess about a whole day commitment, right? Because you go to the beach, it's an hour drive, you probably wouldn't want to go down for a few hours. More the whole day, would they?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): That would be more a Saturday. But of course, it wouldn't be every Saturday.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): how many times and say a month, once? Once a month? Okay. you go down on Saturday morning and come back?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's something to look forward to. Yes. Is that something that would be okay, in terms of like, because on Friday night, potentially, you'd be out. and then Saturday.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, if I, if all those Saturdays that I know that I'm going I could not be out too late on that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's a good idea. you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out? Yes. When you know that Saturday is coming
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): or not go at all, that's fine. Either way,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): take a break that time. Yes. Restore. All right. that's four separate objectives. And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment take a break, and print this up for you. Okay, we'll work on the rest of your goals next time but I want you to have this you can get started on it away. before I print these up as a changes you want to make
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): um, I would to try that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And if it doesn't work, can we tweak? yeah, we can always make changes. Maybe certain things will work really well. It Certain things, we'll have to take off the list altogether, maybe substitute something else. Yeah, we can, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here. Okay, we can make a document that changes as as needed. But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go and print this up as it is, and give you a copy and we can resume with today's session. And then next time I see in a week, or call the rest of the treatment plan. Beside the plan, yes. Thanks, Allison.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you.
Summary: The patient has felt a little depressed and wish to reduce those feelings. The patient has been stressing out doing homework and walking has helped them before to give some relief. The therapist clarifies organizing homework differently in small bits will help instead of last minute. The patient enjoys singing as it is a social activity. The patient also loves going to the beach and visiting their aunt. The therapist works out a plan with the patient. The plan is to walk every wednesday at 6:30 for the amount of time they are comfortable with. The patient would take three hours at max to complete their homework. The plan discussed is to do homework on wednesday right after the walk, then on Thursday and Sunday. The patient agrees all those feel realistic and achievable. The patient also adds a two hour plan on Friday evenings which is not every Friday. The therapist finally adds the whole day commitment to drive down to aunt's place once a month on any saturday.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Um, things you know, I've been really sort of preoccupied and anxious a lot this week. My daughter got sick. I had to take three days off of work to take care of her and I'm starting to worry, she's been sick a lot since I've gone back to work she's in daycare. And I've had to take a lot of time off work and I'm getting close to going over my allotted amount of days. And I'm finding myself being very anxious about that and then feeling guilty because when I'm trying to take care of her, I'm always worrying about work so,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay, sounds a couple things may be going on. In child has been sick youre taken off days. there's a little worried about your relationship with your employer. At the same time, you want to make sure you're taking good care of your child having trouble reconciling those two.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. What was the last time it happened, can you described what happened?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): The last time I had to take off work?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It was this week. She woke up one morning with a really high fever. I had to call out that day and then she still had a favourites The next day, and then I had to take a third day because she has to be fever free before she can go back to daycare. the first day was, I was with that. But then the second and then when I started realizing that I was going to have to take a third day, and I really start to get kind of panicky and were worried about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, let me see. Let's go through each day. Right. the first day when we discovered that she was sick, well, we Thinking that when you had to call out of work
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): well, because she's been sort of sick a lot lately, I was a little bit worried. And I was sort of, you know, I have this number 10 because I only have 10 days for the whole year. I had this number in my head and I thought, Okay, well, there's one more day I got to take away from that 10 that I have, and but I was able to sort of think about, I was a little worried about any work that I would miss, you know, keeping up with my caseload and stuff at work, so, but I was able to kind of figure out that I would be for a day and I can kind of make up for that when I get get back.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you're thinking was this isn't ideal, but I can I can live with it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): one, one day?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How about one on one, day two, when you realize that you're gonna have to take a second day,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): and I got a little bit more worried and then I did start to also, you know, add the worry of I was going to start to get behind at work. Not only was I missing more time, but I was also going to be behind on my work. then I started thinking, when I go back, it's going to be a mad scramble and kind of catch up and keep up with everything. And you know, it was going to became worrying about my workload and worrying about taking more time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. a little more stressful version of what happened on day one. And then how about when you discovered that you had to take a third day off?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I was then it was more amplified, you know, amplified worry, and it was a lot harder for me to let it go. I kept thinking I kept going back to it. And then I started feeling guilty. Because I was preoccupied worried about that. And I was trying to answer emails and do some stuff and send out some emails to people that I work with to try to help me out with things at work since I wasn't there. And then I felt guilty because I wasn't really caring for my child as best as I felt I should have been, you know, I started feeling kinda a bad mom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): guilty and a bad mom. And that was mostly on third. That was the worst of it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now this go up against the weekend was the third day Friday. All right, so, then you kind of knew that by Monday, things would be better. tell me what happened when you returned to work on Monday?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, I checked in with the main office and you know, I said I'm really you know, I'm starting to worry I'm getting I know I'm had to take a lot of time. But you know, I've done the best I can to try to make other arrangements but my, you know, starting back in, starting in daycare, she's been sick a lot, and I can't control it. I'm doing the best I can. You know, I asked them if there was anything I needed to do as far as providing doctor's notes and stuff. And they said no, that they you know, they don't need a doctor's note since it was my daughter that was sick. They said there's nothing nothing that I really couldn't do and try to not have it happen much more if I can
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do what I can to not miss more. they said that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, but yeah. They kind of said, you know, do what you can do not have it happen, but if it you know if it has to happen, you know, what can I do about it? It was kind of they were saying
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): so, they were understanding?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I didn't feel they were that understanding, but I also didn't feel they were gonna take any punitive action against me, right, then and there or anything.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Did you anticipate worst reaction than you experienced?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I did. And I also anticipated that they would maybe have more of a procedure for how to handle it and they didn't have a procedure which also made me feel a little worried. I can't imagine I'm the first mom that has had to deal with this. And they kind of talked It's never happened before. I kind of felt anxious, because I thought, am I really the first mom that's had to take a lot of time off because their child sick. They didn't give me the impression that they had sort of a protocol or they had dealt with this before.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): As a sort of it took them by surprise?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, or they didn't have a plan for what to do about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And they were investing a lot of energy in thinking about that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, no, I guess not.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And when was the second how long?

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, earlier you mentioned being a good mom How a good mom look lik?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): somebody who takes care of their child and puts them makes them a priority, their first priority. And, you know, does the things that they need to do to make sure their child is taken care of.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you're a little worried through this was last experience you're talking about that you didn't rise level of good mom?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I felt I wasn't being a good mom because I was preoccupied and making work a bit of a bigger priority than taking care of my kid.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, good, mom's more about More than rather, your behavior, right, what you're doing is about what you're also thinking. you took care of your child.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But your mind, your thoughts are somewhere else some of the time. And that's where you feel you've, you've wandered out of the good mom area. Okay, I've been on the other side, how about a good employee? Did you mention that? You want to be a good employee?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What's what's that look like?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Um, well, somebody that, you know, takes care of all of their workload and handles all of the tasks that they have each day and someone that's consistent and reliable, and, you know, puts effort into what they're doing and gets their job done. Really, you know, reliably.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that's where you feel with the sort of the last workdays you missed. You missed three. Okay, how about last year? How many days have you missed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I missed a lot for maternity leave.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's understandable but excluding that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I've missed out since the school year started, I've missed if you include the three. I've missed nine days. But some of those were half days. They add up to nine days.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, total nine?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you're allowed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): 10 per school year, it's only January and I'm already at nine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can see that will cause worry what happens if you go over the 10
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't know. I mean, I think that they would dock my pay for the for those for it. If I was there a day and I didn't have any more sick days left. They would dock my pay for that day. But outside of that, I don't know what else would happen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is anybody that you work with that you could ask that question to HR department?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I guess I could contact the HR department.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm thinking because you're one day away, from being at that number might be prudent to talk with them and see. See, you know what to expect, right? this whole thing though, the missing days caused you anxiety, frustration.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, a little bit
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): about any type of feeling down at all?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): A little bit sometimes when I start feeling I'm a bad mom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that as far as your child is concerned in your relationship with your child, yes, some anxiety relationship at work, some anxiety, but the sadness mostly surrounds how you feel you're treating your job. Of all the emotions of frustration, anxiety, what I'll refer to as depression I should say sadness. What's bothering you the most? What? emotional response is probably the most?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): probably sort of the guilt and the feelings of not being able to be the best mom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How would you rate yourself now as a mother if say 10 was the best mother you could imagine? Right? And one was the absolute worst?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'm probably an eight.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. That's pretty good, right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What would be the cutoff to where? What's the cutoff score? And that will scale I gave it for good mother and not good mother.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I guess halfway like,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): five is good enough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, feel It's not good enough for me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I wouldn't be with that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you look at somebody else, another person in similar situation of five would be acceptable. Right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Probably. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But how about for you specifically?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's not
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's not gonna cut it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, we've cut it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't know. At least a seven.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and you're an eight
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): sure?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): not sure. Okay. you're close to the border. you're close to the border on you're your value system of being not a good mother.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yes, not as good a mother as I want to be
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Now, what do you want to be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I want to be a eight or higher,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): eight or higher where you are in s you said?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay. you want to be the parent sounds
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, yeah, doesn't everybody want to be the best at what they do?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I think people are driven to, to do their best. But is it crucial to be perfectly crucial to be a 10?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, there's some leeway, I guess you have to allow for that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Remember before in other sessions for the situations you've brought in here, we've talked about dysfunctional thinking, irrational thinking. How does reflect on that, the usefulness of of these thoughts? The, you know, the other mothers can be a five and B. And that's, that's good, right? You need to be an eight or hire a nine or 10 , does it seem useful, a useful way of thinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): In some ways, it's useful because it keeps me keeps me on track if that makes sense. It keeps me pushing to keep doing the best I can.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it does have a useful side does have an unusual side less than useful?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, yeah, I guess it does in the sense that if I become too worried about it, then I'm wasting energy on worry instead of being able to put that energy into being good mom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I guess one things I'm getting at here is has to worry has the anxiety or it paid off for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Probably not.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Why not? you're suffering with it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it might make you a little more vigilant but mostly most, it's causing suffering.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): at the heart of it, you're not a bad mom. Right? You're in good mom category. You're a good employee. Right. But your, your way of dying yourself, Your perception is that you're not doing a great job at either one.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that's the thinking I'm getting that it's not, you know, it's not necessarily irrational. I'm thinking it's less than useful. It's dysfunctional.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I can see that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, we're talking about that third day, right. The the third day of work you had to you had to call off. And do you remember any specific thoughts that are going through your mind on that? What was that a morning when you figured it out? a Friday morning?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Um, no, it was really the night But, um, well, you know, I went as far as to think, am I gonna get fired? You know, I had to kind of think about
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your thought was, am I gonna get fired?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And then what was the feeling that that came after that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): panic and worry Oh, yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe some anxiety?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): some anxiety? Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Were you able to do anything to address that panic or your anxiety at that time? Like, did you tell yourself anything? Or did you take some action?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Oh, I did tell myself that I didn't go over yet. And, you know, hopefully I won't, you know, there's still a chance that I'm not going to go over on my days and hopefully won't go far as to fire me, you know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and how did you feel after you consciously had that thought?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): a little bit better, but the still kept hovering around. Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the whole time. Probably all the way till Monday, when you returned to work?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to call somebody at work and talk to them about it and make sure it was okay. But you know, it was the weekend, I couldn't do any of those things. I had to wait it out. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): we've talked before about self talk, you might remember me saying the phrase adaptive response, right? it's the kind of pre packaged response we have two thoughts that we've identified is not useful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): degree, those thoughts like, Am I going to get fired and all that? Not very useful in that moment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes. not useful in that moment
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): understandable. Right, but not useful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what's you had sort of some self talk that you apply on your own, what some other self talk with some other another thought that you could think or something you can say yourself that could counter an automatic thought that. Like, specifically, I'm gonna lose my job.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I guess I could say, you know, I didn't, you know, I'm not. I haven't had any conversations with anybody that have indicated that. sort of maybe I need to not worry about it or cross that bridge when I come to it kind of thing. Like, hopefully it won't. I don't know if it will happen or not. And hopefully it won't happen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, there the self talk there is there's no clear indication that's gonna happen,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): why borrow the worry? Right? How about other habit adaptive behaviors? We talked about the importance of support systems before other sessions. Is there anybody else that could watch your child if you were really running up against that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, my mom can. can sometimes I did call her this this week to see if she could take one of take a day. But she couldn't because of what she had going On, but in in other times she might be able to take a day and stay home or my sister can do that as well. And my husband can sometimes it depends on what is going on that week for him at work. there are some options there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Did you explore those options for this last time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I did. I did, but the circumstances didn't work out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): none of those individuals were available?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is there any other options you have for care? Was that it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): That's really it. You know, when she's sick, and that's really it, because you don't i don't want to put her around any other kids, which is why I wouldn't send her to daycare.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that seems reasonable. Okay, there are some things you've already done. Right. And I think at this point, since to address I know this is the lesser of your worries, which is your employer, you're more worried about being a good mom, but to go look at the employer side first. Second, you can talk to HR, you can try to understand what the consequences are for going over explained that doesn't appear to be your fault.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And I don't know what you can do in terms of support, maybe try to get a better awareness of the schedules when they're available and or convey the nature of your problem to them. Customer Support
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that was one issue. Now if you highlight more prominently though, the good mother want to touch on that as well. You did everything you had to do to care for your child?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Are you sure?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): hundred percent ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Except for my my thinking I was maybe a little not as present as I should have been.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And we'll get to that but your behavior behavior. Yeah, you did everything a good mom would do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. is it okay? If you're doing everything you need to do to think thoughts that don't seem congruent with that, you know, the distract you away from that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I guess it's not ideal, but it's okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's not ideal. you'd really rather be have the ability to be really focused on what's going on your child to the exclusion of what's going on other circumstances?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): you know, or at least be able to put my worry about the other circumstances aside for the time for that time period.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): by addressing the employer issue, that might give you a little relief one good mom ish. All right. here's another opportunity to talk about dysfunctional thoughts. I think that is reflect on whether you're a good mom or not, you're really basing it on this idea that if I'm thinking about something other than my child, I'm in the wrong place in terms of being a good mom. Are you only being distracted?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that pushes you on a one to 10 scale?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the more thoughts you have that you think of it as pushing you down toward five.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. when you have those thoughts what's an adaptive response or you know, self talk, what can you tell yourself in those moments?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): that I'm doing them behaving doing the behaviors that I need to do and the baby doesn't know what I'm thinking probably not. She doesn't know what I'm distracted or worried. I'm not doing any harm to her.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Who doesn't know you're distracted or worried?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): I guess me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the self talk that would be I'm doing what I have to do to be a good mom. And that's what my child says.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But I have these understandable thoughts that come in where I worry about other things and more or less justice what it is, right? I mean, you're permitted to worry about things life isn't going to be worryfree
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But we can, we can work to not suffer more than we have to
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That kind of makes sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. It makes sense. And, you know, when you say it back to me the things that I'm saying it does sound a little bit irrational, or unhelpful less than useful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it's a little less than useful it's not, you know, I want this important distinction. It's not good or bad right. And those words have a function in our in our lives, but they're a little dangerous when applied in terms of mental health when they're applied to things you know, good mom, bad mom.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But doesn't leave a lot of gray area to talk about. improvement. Right? Also, it seems what you're describing your, your way into the good mom category anyway. Sure. 8 or 10 I think most people would be happy with an eight out of 10.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): TRUE
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's not you've drifted down toward five before somewhere. Okay. there's a couple different Yeah, I know we talked about two different subjects, right, but they're related the work situation and situation care for a child. But those are some self talk strategies. I'd you to do when you go home today, and I would I would ask you to do it today if you can. Okay, I think it's important in the states in terms of time, near when we're having this conversation. If you could try to document some of those automatic thoughts. Remember, I gave you a worksheet before and then work on some of your own calm adaptive response.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe around this area or maybe about other areas as well, it doesn't. It's okay. If you have other problems you'd want to apply the model to, but certainly around this issue of the childcare versus the work performance. That's the real struggle that's going on now inside of you. Is that right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you think you'd be able to have that completed? next week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah, I think I can handle that. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. we'll leave it there and I'll see you next week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, thank you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=nan] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks, ma'am.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Little stressed, What's going on?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, as you know, I'm in a graduate program now. And I'm really coming to the near the end of my program and I'm finding it increasingly difficult. I'm really stressed with how things have been going.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, we've talked about some different struggles you've had as you balance work and school and everything. What specifically is bothering now it seems you're a little more distressed today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I don't I don't, I don't really know. It's I am, as I've told you, before, I take school really seriously and I really strive to do well, in school and on my assignments and I feel I'm not performing, as as I needed to
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what kind of grades you've been getting lately?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I've been getting A's,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): anything else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. That's usually considered pretty good, right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. I feel it's getting harder to get the As
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay, you're working hard to get the same grade?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right, It used to be easy for me to do what my teachers expect and to get good grades. Now I feel it's, it's really a struggle and I'm not doing as as I need to and I'm constantly worried about not doing this well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you been getting any feedback from professors or your classmates about your performance?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): My teachers all seem to think I'm doing well. They I see To get good feedback on my assignments, but I feel I feel I to make sure I'm doing well. I really focus on the details making sure that the instructions are really clear, I'm doing everything, perfectly as an Instructure instructor wants because I'm really afraid that you know, if I'm not really clear on what the assignment is, then maybe I won't do it the way.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, before when you got A's you were working hard to have a job but not to the level of precision in terms of the detail in the assignment that you are now. You're trying to get more information about the assignments, you're working harder to get the same grade that used to get before
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I find myself emailing the teacher almost obsessively, trying to, to clarify the assignment and to make sure do they think I'm doing in class and and what not.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when you're when you're having this feeling that I guess it's a feeling of anxiety or stress, yeah. What's going through your mind? What are you thinking about?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I guess I'm feeling that, you know, I've worked really hard, this whole program and I don't want to mess it up now or, you know, because if I don't get these grades, and I feel what was the use, if I met, then I'm going to be ruining all this hard work, that I've done this whole program if I kind of, if I don't maintain that level of, you know, you said, precision, I feel that I've let myself down or that I'm a failure because I'm, I slacked off at the end of the program and it's close to being done.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what grade would you have to receive for you to feel you have failed
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): probably less than an A. Anything other than A
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): below an A isn't A minus?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I guess I would be with that, but I wouldn't be really happy with it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What about A plus?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I wouldn't be that excited about that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a B?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I wouldn't be happy with that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, no, it'd be worse. Okay. an A you can tolerate an A minus you're not exactly sure but you think you could
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But a B plus and a B?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): to me like, an A minus I would maybe be with but like, below that to me a B, whether it's a B minus A B, A, B plus it's all B, and that's not an
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what would it mean to you if you received a B?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): that I didn't try hard enough, but there's something else I could have done to to do better that I was like, slacking or I didn't read the directions or I didn't have enough responses or make my paper long enough. I didn't do enough.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you didn't try hard enough that you didn't do enough. What would it mean If that were true?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): If I didn't try hard enough that I was lazy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That you were lazy?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, that I could have tried harder and I didn't. why didn't I try? I didn't, maybe I didn't care. I was lazy. Kind of what's the use? If you're not gonna try your best and why try it all?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, now we we've talked before about automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions in other sessions and one of the cognitive distortions is this idea that unuseful type of thinking and Aaron thinking is when you think of everything in terms of like, Black or White, all or nothing? sounds you have a little tolerance for an A minus you're not completely there. But generally, it's kind of an A of some type, right? Or you're not interested. Right. we get down to you didn't try hard enough and if that were true, the new would be lazy. Right? Which, you know, having senior these last few sessions is clear to me. You're not lazy. But that's the body.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now, it seems that earlier in your earlier years in the program, this was the Acer effortless for you, but you'd have to work as hard for them.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what's what do you think has changed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'm not quite sure. it didn't stress me out as much in the beginning of the program. I really school. But now I feel I'm static because it's anxiety producing for me because, you know, I'm constantly worried
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You mentioned part of it was you can get close to the end, right. is there anything else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, the only thing I can think of is we have the same students throughout our program. But I guess this semester there's a new student in the program and I know that you mentioned and it seems she's kind of really stressing me out. And also see throughout the program, I kind of considered myself to be the student who got the best grades and there's this award at the end of the program for doing really well. And I kind of made it a goal of mine to get this award at the end because I felt that would show that I really tried hard this program really meant a lot to me. I think You know, it would show people who viewed Did that, you know, I really busted my butt and, and did a good job in this program. And for the whole program far, you know, that was me that was I was kind of the front runner, I guess for this award. And this semester, there's a new student and then come to find out she had a 4.0 in her other program. So,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if I'm reading you, right, you you really didn't have any competition for this award that you were aware of. Right? And now you feel you really do,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I feel the pressures on like, I felt I tried hard, this whole program and now this new person comes in, and she might want a different me I really need to go above and beyond to make sure that I'm still on track.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm paradoxically that's caused you to be more anxious and more stressed and your performing but you're still getting the A's which are working harder to get the A's,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right. And it's causing me a lot of anxiety with school where it's not as enjoyable for me as it once was.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what would it mean if you couldn't get the award if you didn't with the, what's the name of the new was first name with a new choice choice? Okay, but of choice once award, and you didn't want me?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I guess part of me feels them. Why did I do the program? if, you know, part of me feels if you're not going to be the best why try? if, if she got the award over me, then it's kind of like, why did I work hard this whole time, I could have been slacking this whole time and skated by why did I bust my butt? If it was all for nothing? I don't have anything to show for it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): its all or nothing if you don't win the award.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I guess it's not the only thing that matters part of me feels that way sometimes that I have these thoughts that if I don't try my hardest and do and win this award, then why do I try hard the rest of the time, but it negates all the positive things. This that this, you know, kind of the end result if you tried hard the whole race and then you lose, you know, at the end.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right, but you're not really losing a race because you would still graduate?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're you're not getting a word, which you would like, and which would be great. Right, and certainly accomplishment. But the reason you came to the program was to get the degree,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): and even know about the award until probably the second year anyway, that wasn't the reason I entered. But,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but it's now it's now taken on some importance for you winning award has been a real goal.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): with the new student choice coming in, I have this increased competition.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that's causing me anxiety is caused you to work hard for the same grade. All right. So, as we talked before, you have a tendency to be, I mean, this as a compliment a little perfectionistic. Right. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. It is taking too far, It can be it can be not useful. Ever hear the phrase Perfect is the enemy of good. No. Does that make sense what that might mean?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. this desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing you not even to perform well. Right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're still getting the A's but it's called the anxiety and you're working hard and
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): now I'm not even I feel when I read, like, I'm stressed with it from reading the thing and memorizing every word that I'm not retaining all the information, it could and it's starting to impact school.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): is there any way that you cannot win the award and still walk away? having accomplished worthy goals? Or does it have to be the award or none of this was worth it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, it kind of sounds silly when you when you're reflecting it back to me how, you know that I have to read the words I, I think that it makes sense. You know, that wasn't my goal going into it. You know, why does it matter much to me that there's different degrees of success. I think if you've said before that is Not all about the award, I think I would be happy with just, you know, getting the degree and all the stuff that I've learned. And I would feel it was, if I didn't get the award rather, I would feel it was still a worthwhile journey. But in the moment, sometimes it's really upsetting at the thought of not getting the award. But that's a possibility.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Your word validates all the hard work you've done.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And in your mind, losing the award invalidates all the hard work you've done, right? But in reality, there's probably a between ground there might have been a shade of gray, where you're still an excellent student, you still graduate, you don't have an extra plaque hanging on the wall, whatever the word is, right. That's really all you'd be missing. Right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yep
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): With this award have any impact on employment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't think I am thinking about I don't think of a long term many people would know about it besides me, or if I put it, you know, on a resume or something, but I don't think it would make that much of a difference.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you didn't know about it when you first came in, and you're already working hard.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): at the beginning, I didn't even know about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in a sense, and of course, we can't do this, for the sense of you could forget about the award. Right? You probably win it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Because you're already doing well. But the thought of this potential failure, away the word that's holding you back,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right, It makes me it makes me paranoid to make mistakes or to try and take risks or to really, you know, do because I'm worried about judgment, from my teachers, if I'm doing enough.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, there's no there's no tolerance for any type of mistake?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Right. Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): now that with the award out there, you really feel you can't make any type of mistake or you go to, to a catastrophe?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Right, I'm walking on eggshells, and I'm expecting my grades to tank if I if I kind of deviate from that line.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): free for you to feel better about this one way, I guess would be to not help have to not place much value in way.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's really hard.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, you really want that. And it would be great. And that's okay. Right? We talked about the adaptive responses before, right? What are what's your automatic thought you have when you're sitting there and trying to get every assignment and you you're kind of vaguely thinking about not losing or not winning this award was the automatic thought that comes to mind?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): if I'm you If I want when I'm doing the work,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, when you're doing your work, and you sense that anxiety come on, as you start maybe vaguely thinking about winning or losing this award, right? it's losing it Really? What's going through your mind that moment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I guess I'm kind of running through a checklist. Did I do this? Did I do this? Did I do this? Making sure I did everything that was expected of me
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to ensure that you're gonna get that award?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. at a higher level, one of your thoughts is, I must win that award.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that make sense? I mean, that that's probably somewhere. Is there any type of adaptive response you could apply that moment, that statement, or kind of, well, that's an absolute statement, right? I must win that award. Is there any type of adaptive response you could play at that moment that could counteract that on thought
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): That I must win the award?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I guess I could say that, you know, this, the award is something local to my university and no one's going to know about it in the grand scheme of things. it won't really impact future employment or what my colleagues think of me. You know, if I, if I don't get the award that they won't think less of me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you could say, it'd be nice to win the award. But in the end, it's not really gonna make the difference in my life in terms of my career
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and, and that's a fair, adaptive response, right? You do want to win it, right? Truthfully, and it would be nice to win it right. Who doesn't want to win the award, right? But if you don't, you were still good student. You're still gonna be a good connection and your career still good before. Do you believe in that adaptive response? Do you believe that adaptive response is true?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I feel sometimes I do. And then sometimes it's really hard in the heat of the moment to kind of talk myself down from that, that kind of spiral of not doing this assignment, right? I'm not doing well. I'm going to get to be in this class, I'm going to lose this award. I feel it starts. It's hard in the moment to spiral out of that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what percentage of the time Do you believe that adaptive response is true?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Maybe half the time,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 50% of time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right? depends on what's going on in my stress.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And the other half, you're not really buying.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. what advice Well, let's use choice, right? choices in the same situation, in a sense, in that she's, well, maybe not knowing what she is working toward this award as
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't even know she knows about the award.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Let's assume. Let's assume she knows about it. Right? He's in a similar situation. What advice would you give her? She's kind of obsessing about this in the same way that you are.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. I think I would tell her that, you know, the rest of the class sees that she's doing well. Her teachers give her positive feedback. all science would point towards that you're doing really and you're being very successful in the program that you're getting positive feedback from them. that all the signs the feedback is telling you you're doing a really good job.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Your advice to her seems positive and uplifting. Mostly, your advice to her is more positive, uplifting what you're telling yourself internally,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): definitely it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if that advices adequate. I feel It is adequate and appropriate for her. Why isn't it adequate probably for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't know sometimes I feel I hold myself to a higher standard than I hold other people to if some a friend of mine Joyce would come and tell me the same situation, you know, I'd be able to give her a whole bunch of, you know, suggestions or some positive feedback, but it's really hard for me sometimes because I hold myself to a higher standard than other people.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you would agree your advice to choice as you frame it to me is useful, right? But you're having trouble applying that to yourself?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Smooth. That's what you need to work on a bit. you can kind of see the logic of all this, but your feelings don't match.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Correct. Makes sense in my head and I would know what to tell someone else but I don't always believe it. When I say to myself,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, here's what I want you to do. You familiar with the thought record that I introduced you in the first session where you can outline your situation and your feelings and you've explained all this to me, I want you to complete one thought records.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know after having set it all might seem doubling the work. But I think it's something changes when you write something down. Okay, I have to face it on paper. And also, it's a good tool to remember exactly what you're thinking. And then work through the adaptive response section and their smiles at the bottom of thought record questions you can ask yourself to help you form that adaptive response. And maybe write out a few different ones. But there's plenty of room on the forum. You see it, right,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's the largest grid cell is the one on adaptive responses, that the responses don't have to be short. yours wasn't short. There's really good they can they can be long and they can be realistic, like, I'd to win. It would be good to win. But Alice should have to be successful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I thinl the adaptive response kicked out is to the downside of not having success, okay? It doesn't have to be completely positive. Okay, has to be realistic and useful. And, as importantly, you have to believe it. Okay, there's a place on there to note what percentage you believe that you could write that in. Okay, I know we'll look at that from week to week and, you know, as we move closer to your graduation, hopefully it'll bring you some relief for missing anxiety.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that's sounds a good plan?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I moved into an apartment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's the first time that
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm on my own. And I kind of had heard that someone got robbed and ever since then. I'm kind of nervous about my apartment getting wrong.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Someone someone was robbed. near where you live.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Someone in the same complex. Okay. Sometimes when I'm sleeping, I'll wake up in the middle of the night, and I'll think that
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I locked the door. Is the door locked? And I can't fall back asleep.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How long does it take you to fall back to sleep?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sometimes it takes maybe an hour two.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm worried that I left the door unlocked. And sometimes I'll hear sounds. And I think maybe someone's in the apartment or I just, I get nervous. I get scared.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That sounds scary.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And you said a couple hours to stay away.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah. this is this is troubling for you. Have you ever gotten up and check the door?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now I sit in bed, and I try to I think about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you keep thinking about it. Does it get worse as the time goes on? Or does it get better? What happens?

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, I try to fall back asleep, and I stay in bed and I think, you know, maybe I did leave the door unlocked. And then I keep thinking that maybe it isn't locked.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): keep cycling through the same
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you ever do anything to try to get those thoughts to go away focusing on something else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, well, I have a ceiling fan above me. sometimes, I'll like, count how many times it goes around and to distract myself from thinking about it. But I still think about the door being unlocked. Sometimes it helps.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Right? you have have a fear that somebody is going to enter break in To where you live, and you're staying up at night thinking about whether the doors been secured. That's been that's been troubling. Anything else?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, sometimes if I'm leaving for work, I'll get to my car and I'll think I let the hair Sugarland. And I'll think to myself, should I go back? I don't know what to do. And I'll just, like, kind of debate whether or not I should go double check. I'm worried that if I left the straightener on something, you know, that would happen,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): What do you think happen?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I mean, if I left the strainer on something, you know, it's if I have clothes or something and it's it's on a quad that burn, or if it's I don't want anything. I don't want to place the burn down was nervous about.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when you leave, you're thinking about it was a hairspray Are you thinking about whether you unplugged it or not? Or turn it off or not?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how long those thoughts go on for?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Normally I think about it before I get to my car, and I'm like, well, maybe I should go to make sure I unplugged it and I turned it off. And then sometimes during the day, I'll be at work and I can't focus because I'm thinking about, I'll come back and I'll see you know, my apartment burned down I left the strainer plugged in.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, remember with the door you're saying that you you struggle with those thoughts, but you don't get up and check the door. Have you ever come back and checked to see if something was left on?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I haven't. But it I think about it. I would if I did leave it. If I did leave it on or plugged in.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): more quiet. It's not always yelling at me. Because I think it I mean, sometimes it might still say something but not in the urgency that it had before.

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And today you're able to kind of shove that internal critic back a little. And allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with the decision you've made.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do you feel is helpful technique?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I do. I, you know, I think that separating the two sides helped me realize which one felt stronger.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I saw the thing that your name is Elizabeth, and I'm not sure if that's what you go by,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I mean, Liz would be the best.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All right, great. this one of the things I wanted to talk with you about is I know that you did some assessments over the last couple of days. And I want to talk with you about that and talk with you about kind of treatment and how things are going to go. And based on that sounds the what, from what you were saying in terms of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder, it's called bulimia nervosa, and I'm not sure if you've ever heard of that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I mean, a little bit yeah. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit. what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, kind of a large amount of food that you feel that you've lost control and you feel, you know, overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly. And there are times to when you, you know, you're maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight. And that feel familiar to you. Yeah. and then it sounds that's been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I, I'd say, Yeah. All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not unusual. For a person in college yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder this. In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, it's not unusual. One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting. going for long periods of time without eating and sounds that that was something that you endorsed as that there are times when you kind of diet excessively. Yeah,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): especially when I was younger.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle. And we know that that's the case. The other thing that we're aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties this also report a lot of difficulties they have with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they're feeling or managing feelings. Is that something that you've experienced? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that's okay. Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties that. And we know that there's a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc. one of the things that I to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals yourself is I take an approach it's called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there's a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you've been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake. And what I'd to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you've had, you know, overeating episodes and when you've restricted your calories, when you've You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we'll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we're together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating. how's that sound? Okay. And there's really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we're going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you'll you'll know pretty quickly that you're gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it'll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating. Okay, great. this is what I'd to do is first of all, first of all, let's start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where recently within the last couple days where you've had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that. And then what I'd to do is and we'll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode that. and then then what we'll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we'll, we'll start from when it started and kind of work our way up to the present. And I'll ask you a lot of questions and we'll, you know, kind of go from there. Right? why don't you tell me the Tell me a recent episode, that where you felt that you'd lost control. You're eating
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): me this Saturday night, I guess. I went out with my friends. And it was fun. It was a good night at first and whatnot.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, I wasn't excited about it. It was kind of a more uppity area. Yeah, I mean, like, it was kind of hard, because they're like, in a private school, these people have kind of been together for a little while. And because there's less people there, they kind of moreso all know each other and have their groups and whatnot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. And then that would have been in around the time when you were 1213 when you made that move. Okay, then, sounds to that that was the time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think I started. Mate, and I felt more pressure from my mom. She was very vocal. towards me about my eating and my looks and whatnot.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): happy let them know that I didn't the school.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And then what when you would do that what would be the risk
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I like, oh, you should feel lucky. it's good school. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Well, many ways, like, one might be putting words your mouth, but what like, kind of get over it or deal with it or, okay. and then you were feeling pressure from her sounds also to that you weren't really feeling that they were really that maybe there wasn't as much concern about your feelings about where you were. Was there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in terms of like, kind of the Get over it? You know that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I mean, you mean in terms of the schooler? My body?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, you're in terms of the school.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, get over it, like, it will get better with time. you have to put yourself out there to meet people.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. So, that kind of pressure. Yeah. And then you said that you didn't really Bruce, what kind of person was a man? What was making you not him well?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, he's kind of a sketchy guy. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, that maybe that there was something going on between Bruce and your mom prior to the divorce? Yeah. Sorry to hear that must have been really hard. Yeah. And were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time? Yeah. Okay. Like, were you? I mean, how what was the arrangement where you're spending time with him sometimes and spending time with your mom?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I said my mom during the week and I got to my dad every other week. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. then, given the fact that in case you weren't happy in school, you said that it was more kind of an uppity school, private school. Kids Was it a mixed school or was it an all girls school? Yeah, mix school and that kind of clicky sounds and then your mom really sounds she really was pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you that you fit in a little bit better. when in this process Did you find yourself turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge things
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): dieting, it's definitely I guess, eighth grade, ninth grade. And that definitely came from like, my mom thinking were telling me that to look a certain way to knit Yeah, and then there were times like, there was unhealthy food around the hospital debris seats. Mm hmm. And is there an accessible at times I would eat that I would say for the most part, I would try to really restrict myself to Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. And do you recall the first time that you then vomited or use vomiting as a way to kind of manage the overeating?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, pressures of starting High School, and I'm in a same school, same people and I really wasn't happy, hard to make friends. I don't know When I guess I heard from some of the other girls about, vomiting as an option, right, that they've heard some of their friends talk about before. Right? Right. Yeah, so, okay. And the dieting even though if I was eating healthy, I would still hear from my mom like, oh, you need to look this, right? Here's this outfit I want you to wear, but you can't wear it if your body's that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): she was really critical of how you looked. Okay, okay, then what was that? What did that do? Let me take a step back. it sounds that. You've always been a little closer to your dad. then what was the divorce and the move and some of that transition? What effect did that have on your relationship with your mom?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I don't even really remember a really good time with my mom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay. All right. the two of you don't get along as well. Okay. Did it was it getting? Was it kind of the same during that time? Or was it getting worse?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I guess I was getting more vocal towards her and speaking my mind more.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. And then she was then coming back more harshly and more critically. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, it's not unusual. I mean, a couple things, certainly not unusual for, you know, girls at that age, you know, in terms of like, kind of the social influence or kind of the social contagion of, you know, with eating and diet, you know, binge eating and dieting and vomiting. it sounds that, that was kind of, in some respects part of that culture. But it also sounds that there, you know, in terms of the external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look a particular way. It almost sounded that, that she was saying that you were like, What? You were too heavy for a particular outfit. And then, I'm sure that that Do you remember how that was feeling to you at that time when she would say things that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Today? Yeah, I felt nothing I could do. Right. Right. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All cut of Trump. Did you talk to anybody about that? Did you talk with your dad about that? Or?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's like, No, not really. Okay. We have.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. you kept a lot of those feelings to yourself. Okay. All right. Okay, well, that's that's, that's helpful. Let's kind of let's kind of hang on to that, because we've got a couple things because obviously, I think the the divorce the move the transition from middle school to high school. Also sounds though that also during that time that you're obviously you didn't have a very good relationship with Bruce to begin with. And that your relationship with your mom was kind of deteriorating. Yeah. And then I know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in, in high school, but during that time, like, you know, eighth or ninth grade, did you have more contact with her? Were you able to,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): connect with her on that as much as I could? She also I mean, she didn't live in That's where I was living. when I would see my dad occasionally we got,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): okay, okay. Okay, um,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, I love, we're really close and I love her. But as as training as an only child and then your mom gets remarried and soon after a new baby And others also like, my mom and stepdad, they both worked a lot. And there's also like, I was kind of looking after Brooke, got Okay. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, then, right? not only did Where's your relationship with your mom kind of deteriorating, then all of a sudden, she's pregnant, she delivers. You have a baby sister. They're working. And now not only are you kind of feeling distressed about your relationship with her, but now you're also feeling the pressure to take care of a baby sister. Okay. Okay, and so, during that time, you're feeling what?

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): were you binge eating more during that time then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, and I mean, because I kind of found other ways to make up for the binge eating.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right, such as throwing up, vomiting. Okay, then that, that kind of began to that started during that particular time. Okay. All right. That's, yeah. Okay. That's really helpful to get that.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, I think more that, you know, my ideas were kind of higher than what they could really Understand, maybe learn how to how to talk to other people that they can understand me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, what would you mean by higher, like, your ideas
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): are higher, you know, a little bit more intelligent, you know, I'm at a level that other people can't always reach to, you just, you know, a little bit higher, sometimes a lot higher, but on this team, they couldn't understand, you know, my language or what I was saying, and it couldn't see the vision that I had.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, they were unable to reach your level of expression for this was a project you're working on? And your boss recognized this difference, and thought that, that the counselor may be helpful. Yeah?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think it's good, you know, that my boss is happy that I went, but I think it could also be useful in the sense of, you know, other people are jealous of me a lot, and they can't really relate to me. it might be, you know, great to learn how to relate, you know, like, kind of understand what they're going through at their level.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Again, you stay at their level. are you meaning again, that they're kind of below you with skills?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah, they're they haven't they haven't accomplished as much they have, you know, they don't know as many people, they're not hanging out with those prestigious ranks, you know, they haven't been educated to the quality that I have been. they sometimes it's hard for them to understand where I'm coming from, or you know, what I can see happening.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, counseling can help you bridge that gap to go to communicate more effectively.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think you know, I can even better you know, I'm here but I want to be here.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): When you say you're here at the first level,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): maybe a seven but I want to blow it out. The park, you know, if 10 is here, I want to be higher than that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How would you plan on accomplishing that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, you know, I'm always getting recruited for these really prestigious classes and to speak places and people are always calling I'm a really large social media presence when people are constantly asking me for advice, you know, about everything, because, you know, I've accomplished much that I can really help people because I just, you know, I've been really lucky to be good at many things.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, it sounds you're you have a lot of stress.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And maybe, from your understanding that people were getting jealous because you seem to succeed in many things.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. You know, like, sometimes people just, it's hard to admit that you're not as good or you can't do it. Maybe you don't want to admit that I think I make them uncomfortable because I can.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): calcium help you to relate to them in a way that how would they have a more productive way? How would they describe you? You know, given this level of difference on this, you're talking about how would they describe you, if I were to ask them, if I could ask them. Could you describe sample?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Would they say? I think they would say that I have a lot of people that look up to me that I'm excellent at my job that, you know, like, I should really be vice Vice President, if not president, but I mean, I don't own the company. But I should really have a more significant position. that a lot of the presentations that are happening that I could probably do, but they don't want to, you know, other people need opportunities, but it would, it would be clear for everyone if I did them.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Would It be easier?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, you know, easier, better, more people. It would be it would be a great presentation if I did it. we'll cut away all the other stuff.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah. Things that maybe detract from them.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Right. if you know, if I was doing the sales pitches, we could blow it out of the park. I mean, we'd be multimillionaires by now. You know, it would get rid of all that, you know, the grunt work type of stuff, if I did it myself,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): does it frustrates you that you're not calling for every task?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You're not recognized sometimes, but I've gotten really good at reminding people that they shouldn't be calling on me for every task. Because I'm, you know, sometimes you have to show them, you know, I'm better than that person, or I could do it better. And I'm really good at that type of communication. I've been able to secure a lot of positions that weren't given to me at first, because they realize like, Oh, she's better at it. they can see your talent.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): they recognize you most of the time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No I mean most of the time. Yeah

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): an AI algorithm. They, I got it, I got it to a really, you know, large leadership position. And then, you know, the other VP couldn't really see, see what I was going for. She couldn't relate to me and she, you know, she, she wasn't from the same type of collegiate backgrounds that was kind of an issue. I outgrew what they had to offer. And then this company came in and made this tremendous offer with the you know, it was just, it was fantastic. I had to make a move that was more strategic for me. And you know, that I could that I could even reach more. You know, I didn't I didn't want to be satisfied there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You want to you want to shoot higher. You want to accomplish something greater?

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And I, you know, I want to make my boss happy, but I feel it would be good. You know, I don't want to make people feel bad because they're inferior to me. And because they're not as successful. if I could learn how to even talk with them that I'm not, you know, they don't feel bad about themselves.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It's your boss putting, I mean, she encouraged you to come here today. Is she putting any pressure on you? Like, is this something that's strongly encouraged mandatory?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I think it's strongly encouraged. I think she has a promotion for me in mind. it's probably to set me up for that.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It's good to see you. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, good week with the roommates. I had a good conversation with her about like, what times are good for boyfriend to be over and kind of giving him better heads up on when I'm really mean.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Silence. Terrific. what was what specifically? I mean, I know we've talked a lot about that, but what specifically did you say to her, or how did you bring it up
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): is telling her that like, my studies are really important and I understand like, it's also important that she time with her boyfriend, but that I would really appreciate that this is both our space and that there are times when like, we really need to respect each other's space. And yeah, she responded really well. Yeah, she was like, really give me a good heads up before. Terrific. You. Yeah. And that we kind of decided certain times are more appropriate for them to have the living room and not
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): right. Right. Right. Because I think that's really similar No, we kind of talked about that. Because I remember a few sessions ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems one of the ways that you've we talked about that before in terms of like, you know, first starting that oftentimes one of the ways that you manage your feelings that you kind of you think you're letting people know what you're you know, feeling but it doesn't really come out. And I know that it's something that you and I had to really you know, kind of work out but sounds that. You were able to talk with her in that She heard you. And as I want, as I kind of thought that she was really responsive in a very positive way.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think being a little way direct was helpful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It's really nice, I think to you've been able to do that more with me, and I feel that, that I feel it's been really helpful. I know, they've been kind of pushing you on that. And that's been hard, but I feel it's been really nice to feel it's really been helpful with your relationship with Kathy. that's fantastic. And also, you know, again, I know that I've keep, you know, saying this over and over again. But you know, as you've worked on these things, it's been really notable that it's really had a nice positive effect on your eating because it seems it's really you've really seen a lot of real nice improvements. awesome. Anything else that you know, you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything else go on this week? Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): At home for two days, and it was with my mom and Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay. she's still sixers. Did she have a birthday recently?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): He's awesome.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, that's great. almost seven great. You plans for birthday for her or what are you
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): She really into frozen?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay? anything frozen. Okay, okay, okay. Yes. Okay, that sounds terrific. And then you spend some time with her. obviously that was real positive for you. Did you? When you were there? Did you have any opportunity to, you know, visit with your mom? or How did that go? I
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think my mom was around we kind of all spent time together. And she asked about school. They were like, tell her a little more about school and how things are going. Yeah, we don't really get a one on one time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): How does it feel for you in terms of for her? I know you've talked about not really liking that. She all the sudden, is deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of be involved in your life. But how is it for her to kind of want to want to know how things have been going for you. I mean,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I've kind of allowed myself to tell her I guess I don't think have been going. I mean, like, to an extent, it was it broke and whatnot we don't really sit down do together.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): kind of what we had discussed kind of that you've been, you've like, you've been allowing yourself to be more connected with her, but you're still kind of keeping up keeping a little bit of a boundary. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that's gone on, you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it's just, you know, kind of the wondering about that. I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on, but then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke, you know, even I still even remember to, for her to have gotten to the point where she wouldn't even let you go to your grandmother's funeral or at least you know, kind of, all those things have been like, you know, front and center, you know, and now I feel that she's made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being a mom, that sounds that. You're really working to try to manage that in, you know, in a better way?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, we still butt heads a little bit. I'm sure Shane but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah, yeah, but when you do butt heads, what is it how what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of you feel that there's a little bit of a friction.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, I guess that's like, kind of leaps back to things things are really good this weekend for the most part and then kind of when I was leaving she like, either brought up things about wanting to know more about life and whatnot and what's going on at school and if I'm seeing anyone, yeah, it's like, we don't have that relationship.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. that really, that's a really stressful time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when I got back to school after that. And caught me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, you know, we've really reviewed this quite a bit but You know, historically, that's how it's been, you know that that's really been a real enemy. It really clarifies why we're working on this because it's clear that when the two of you have these rough patches, that it really all of a sudden evokes all these negative feelings. And that's when food really, you know,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you know, all comments, though. Yeah. What I'm wearing. Right. Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Right. Yeah. it's really hard to, you know, I can understand it's really hard to let that go. I mean, cuz obviously, there's a lot of lot of feelings that you have about that. Yeah. Yeah. But on the other hand, too, it seems that, you know, things have been going really well. How have things been going in terms of in general school friendships, you know, anything else that's on the horizon?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, kind of scene guy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I won't get too excited about that. But tell me about him telling you about him.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, he felt my mother.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now what's this? You have to at least give me his name? What's his name?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): His name's Alan.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alan. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, did you like, I'm not gonna blow this out of proportion. But how? How did that kind of come about?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, cost together and kind of went and studied at a coffee shop. Yeah. And then kind of asked to, like, do a movie night. And I was like, chill and good. Nice. Ya know, like,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Nice. Nice. That's great. Oh, I'm really happy. That's great. So, a lot of really nice things that are going on. Yeah, that's terrific. Yeah. then for you to go from, you know, because, you know, we kind of got going with this thing. It was kind of like, you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes twice a day, and now it'd be down to, you know, three, in the space of like, you know, seven eight weeks is pretty remarkable. no, I'm really pleased with how hard you've been working cuz you've really been pushing yourself. And I really appreciate it. I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard. It's hard for you
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): is not being able to, I don't feel comfortable really telling her yet about.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And you may not, you know, I mean it's like, you know, another we talked about there's maybe there are times when you don't really want to share some of that stuff. You know, and and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like, you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad. If you would want to share it, you'd want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like, like, Oh, yeah, you were mean to me now have an eating disorder, you know, because then that that feels, you know, that doesn't feel quite right. And know that that's, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don't really feel that. That's how you'd want that to go, you know? Yeah. And I know we've talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad? Yeah,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah. Yeah, he's doing well, hoping that he's coming up here to school to see me once he plays a couple weeks. Great.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): nice. They'll be really nice for you to spend time with them. That's great. That's really great. Yeah. let's talk some more about this thing with your mom, because I feel that. I mean, I know it's tough, but I guess I've been thinking about this a lot, especially after last session that that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke are close, and it does feel that your mom is, at least she seems she's making she's trying to make an attempt to connect with you. Whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel that you? Well, what would you need from her in order to feel that you could kind of like, maybe not let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit. I mean, is there something is there something that like, if you could ask They're like, okay, mom, if you did this, then I would do this. Not that you would do that. But wondering if like, what would you? ideally what would you to see in order to feel that you could connect with her more.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, like, I wish she really recognized like, kind of the pressures that she put on me back in the day, huh? Yeah, and now to know kind of be there in the moment. like, trying hard to like, things still come out. she still makes her little comments that they.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I know. We talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt that you could? Like, even let her know that. That that puts a lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings because I know that in the moment you feel it. But what would it be for you if you were to like, yeah, say like, you know, I know that you're I know that you mean Well, I mean, maybe she doesn't, but maybe it's sometimes important to approach it that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you know, I feel that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way. And, you know,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, I am seeing that I starting to see that she does mean well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): right, because I know that you did that. You've done that with your roommate. I know there's been other times when people have done that. I know that that's been kind of part of the bigger issue is knowing what it is you're feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that and you know, thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem that every once in a while she kind of jabs here, she'll send something out and and, and the way that you take it in is more harsh, critical. You know her and, and I don't know color. It's kinda with Kathy. When you Talk with her how it's like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course, like, you know, uh, you know, I'll try to be more sensitive and I'm not really sure. You know whether or not your mom would be.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I guess she could do. Yes, I worry that, because we've always been kind of defensive towards each other. I worry that like, that will happen again. I mean, I don't know, it might not because of things happen. Right. But
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there are times when I wonder if like, maybe if there's a time when you say something, like, I know there have been times when you kind of snap back at her, you know, or you'll kind of like, you know, barber or kind of jabber a little bit. What if, you know, again, you What have you thought about like, because it sounds that you're really aware when you do that? Because you know that when she says something, you have a tendency to jet back. You could say, you know, You know, I realized I was I, that was a that was a jab at you. And I'm really sorry, I aware that that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I that doesn't I don't feel very good about that. Now I wonder how she would you know if, if that would, what that would do, maybe, maybe it wouldn't do anything or may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but you think about it, I mean, and you kind of Mull that over in your mind about what that might be like, because my experience has been that sometimes. You know, I hate the phrase, be a bigger person, because then you know, I didn't want that to come across that way. But sometimes in order to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like, kind of be willing to do something a little different. And since it seems you have a growing awareness of, you know, the interactions that you have with her I wonder if that might be worthwhile. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. mulling over and think about it and, and we'll keep talking about it. But yeah, sounds it was a really terrific week and been working really hard it really pays off because again, the more you've done that we've seen real positive impact on your eating nice

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I could see these types of decisions where you're talking about potentially breaking families up and having real consequences to families. I could see how these decisions could be. I'm sure there's guidelines you are supposed to follow that you really don't have a whole lot of choice in. But you could also really agonize and overanalyze a decision that because the consequences are great. Maybe somehing that could be happening.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, I think so. I mean, you're right. To a certain extent, we have guidelines and everything that. But I also feel certain things, it isn't black and white, and I have to make a judgment call. And I used to trust my judgment, but now I feel how do I know that I'm making the decisions?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Well, and this is really the one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress. We talked about this insecurity. You're on this I'm sure. And you know, one question may be, did you make a efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family but the larger question is, you as a person can you can you do this, this job and if you do it and make money Like, what would you do then? Could you go through this again?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, I think that's where the fear is, is that if 99 times out of 100 I do it right, there's still gonna be that one that I messed up. And I'm starting to feel that one mistake could be like, life changing for somebody.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And it could be you certainly in a job where, like, most jobs where mistakes have consequences. You also do a lot of good for a lot of people. by you not being in the field. They're not getting the benefit of the skills you have.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess that's true. Like, yeah, maybe somebody else could come and replace me but do I think that they would be better at it? I don't know. I feel I was pretty good at it before I started. have all these doubt.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, mostly This was good until recently. Well, alright, let's look at this from another point of view. You really seem like, you can empathize with these families. You really, to me, it seems you really know what they're feeling.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): Yeah I care about them
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): and appreciating their perspective. Take a moment and try to walk in their shoes. If a professional yourself came to you and your family situation and maybe you're engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family we've broken up temporarily. What would you want? How would you want them to process that? you said, thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family? How would you want them to feel that? Would you want them to process that decision?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't know. That's a hard question. I mean, if they took my kids away, even if it was the thing, I would want them to be at least a little bit, you know, feel a little bit bad about having to make such a hard decision. But I guess if, you know, if they fell apart, every time that they made that kind of decision, they wouldn't be able to help other people.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): from the family's point of view, if you're in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do. Well, you'd to have some compassion for you. Okay, that seems reasonable. Yeah. now flip back into the role you're in. You made the decision you had to make although you're second guessing it That's separate. Do you have compassion for them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, I think that might be the problem is I have too much of it. You know, I worry about how they feel, even if maybe taking the kids away was the thing. It's devastating. To lose your kids, whether you're doing the things or not, you know, you want your kids with you. You want to be able to take care of them, even if you're not doing a really good job at it.
Summary: The patient is involved in making decisions that could potentially break families up. The patient says that things are not black and white and does not know if the judgement made is right. The patient is asked to identify the distressing point, and the patient fears even though they do right 99 out of 100 times, that one messed up will be life changing for somebody. The patient is assured that their skills are useful for the job and they are doing much better work than anyone else. The patient acknowledges that they empathize better with the families. The patient feels at their job, even if taking the kids away was the right thing to do, the caseworker should have some compassion. The patient feels it is devastating to take the kids away and you would want your kids with you even if you are not doing a good job.

<PrimaryTopic: decision> <SecondaryTopic: kids-parents> <GlobalEmotion: -0.05>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes, you really get where they're coming from you really understand the suffering bowl.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I guess maybe that's part of where it's hard for me is like, I know that I'm causing a lot of suffering for people.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, let's, let's talk about that. you're in, you're in a position where you have to make some decisions about people's lives. And sometimes those decisions result in people being separated from the family. Sometimes they don't. Are you really the cause? In the larger picture? Are you really the cause of these families being broken up?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I guess not it's their actions, if they were doing the things, even if I did come in their kids wouldn't be removed. But it is still hard to be the one that pulls that trigger, you know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, you're the immediate cause kind of at the end of the whole process, but the true cause happened years or months before you got there as people made decisions that maybe weren't the best for their children for themselves. you're really coming in, to some extent the tail end of a long series of behavioral choices
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. That's true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Ultimately, for this family that's causing you the cycle that you're worried about. In kind of the looking at the long term lengths, do you think the children are better off? Because they're not with a family now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): I mean, if they get with a good family, which, you know, usually they do. It's, it's good for them, you know, maybe it could be a wake up call for the parents, or if not, at least the kids are getting their needs met and stuff that. It's probably really hard for the kids and they probably want to go back to their parents. But I think overall, we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think that it would be best for the kids to go to a place where they're going to be taken care of.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): immediately, there's some pain because you have to pick up the family but the long run. Maybe there's a better result. Even with that, though, let's talk about the concern you have about making a poor decision. this based on what you're describing, do you believe this was a poor decision?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess not. It feels it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it feels it is. And it was a tough decision. But looking at it in the weight of the evidence. Maybe you can appreciate that you might have had to the same thing you if you go back in time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And I'm not sure anybody else would have made a different decision either.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you really did what you had to do. Because there's still a pain component there for them. You're feeling torn. And you don't want to go through this again?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I mean, not this feeling. But I do want to keep doing my job.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But doing your job in a world where you could make a mistake, that's not as appealing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, I guess I always knew I could make mistakes, but it feels really real now, I guess that is the difference.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): in this particular instance, this what you're saying doesn't seem a mistake. Let's consider a situation where you did make a mistake. That would be the worst case, right? We're taking things to the worst case scenario. Okay. Your fear here is that in a sense, regardless of what already happened, going forward, you'd be mortified to make an error. Because this pain you're feeling now. There's a variable that's thrown everything into chaos for you. looking around where you work and and the history of your profession, what's the mistake you see people make from time to time and you'll be frightened of.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I guess the biggest mistake you can really make is to miss some form of abuse or something that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And then someone's hurt. Okay.
Summary: The patient feels they are causing suffering for a lot of people. The patient acknowledges that it is best for the kids to be removed but hard to be the one to pull the trigger. The patient feels that initially it is a hard decision for the family and kids to be separated but in the long run, it is a better result. The patient feels torn, a pain component and does not want to go through this feeling. The patient wants to keep doing the job and acknowledges they may make mistake in their job. In worst case, the biggest mistake the patient feels they can make is miss some form of abuse and someone's hurt.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Last week you were talking in therapy?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week, but but Jill was telling you about Jill, a co worker. And, you know, she was kind of bothered me the past couple weeks, but really, this this past week was the worst, right? she's not doing her paperwork. And the thing is, is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports. if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine. And then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do theirs and it's a mess. The whole thing's a mess. And it's it's annoying.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): her work slow down, or not being efficient work is affecting your work productivity.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah, it definitely is. And it it's one of those things that like,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you know, has, it gives me a bad
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): a bad evaluation, you know, like, if I'm not in my stuff in in time, the number reflects negatively on me, you know, and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time. she doesn't, then I don't then the next person and forth, and it makes it seem
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're not doing her job,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): right? Yeah. And my boss doesn't it. my boss's boss doesn't and forth. You know, and I try to explain them. You know, she's the problem, but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like, here's what's happening or somehow it doesn't Now,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And that's pretty annoying too. Because,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you know, it's one thing if people get mad at me, but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job, I'm supposed to. But it's another thing for them to get mad at me. Not realizing it's not my fault.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You know, you have an explanation for why that works.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I do. I do. That's the thing. But I can't always get it out. You know, I can always tell the person that's has the complaint about and yeah, I mean, I've tried talking to my, my boss. And I've tried talking other people too, you know, but really hasn't gotten anywhere.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're feeling stuck with this whole thing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I talked to Joe a little bit about it, too. You know, and I tried to ask, I tried to kind of gently reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock. I didn't want to be real abrasive, you know, but I, I tried to remind him as a polite approach. Yeah. Yeah. And it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening. You know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It really hasn't. And, and that's just, I feel I've tried everything that I could try.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You know, and even like, I came home and I
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): was talking to a friend about it, and
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I was trying to think of other solutions, right. You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do what else I could say. Who else I could talk to things that. You know, and my friend, you know, you He was listening and stuff. He had some good suggestions, but he didn't know what to do either cuz he doesn't know the way the company works.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): like, I got nothing. You're not getting the help you need for this.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, not at all feeling pretty lost with it. And I wish there was a
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): clear way to do things this is what you should do now. And I don't see anything some
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): sort of clear plan.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): But yeah, I don't
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't see a way to go about it. I mean I've I've Okay, this is the way I laid out in my mind. I tried talking to the people above me didn't work out the way I thought it would. I tried talking to the people below me to speak, lower on the before me in the process. That's what I mean. And that didn't work out which is Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): like, there's nowhere else I could turn.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): The options are exhausted.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's what it seems to me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And this is frustrating for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it is. And I've been trying to wrack my brain. You know, like, what else could I do? You know, like, maybe if I could maybe if there was like, a committee or something that I could go to, you know, and be like, well, this person's not doing what they're supposed to be doing. But there's not a committee that. Or even if there was a person, you know, like, a resolution person or whatever, but there's nobody that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): There's no other avenue.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It sort of seems to me Yeah. I mean, that's
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): and you know, as I'm even trying to think like,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know, should I Write a letter to somebody maybe. But I don't even know who or what
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you thought about a letter.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But who would you send it to?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Or something else that I can I can do instead of going to this person though to that person that didn't work.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Can I can I
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): call somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff that? But I mean, there's there's HR people, but
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can't really see where they could come in. I don't know how human resources could deal with something that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You don't view them as a potential solution.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No, I don't.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Wondering if there's a
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): But there's I mean, I'm thinking now that there's gotta be something or somebody, or somewhere that I could put in, like, almost a complaint or something like, something's out of my hands. And I don't know what to do about it, but there's got to be something. And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's got to be
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): some other resource you haven't tried yet.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, now I'm trying to think back to my training, you know, initially
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you know, maybe there's, you know what, I think now that I'm, now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about a little bit differently about it. I'm thinking that there's like, man, I forget what they call it now, but maybe a complaint but It's not the word, but maybe a complaint box or suggestions or something. And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting, which we have, every other week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): They're discussed at this regular meeting.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And I'm thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it. But I'm thinking like, maybe that's an avenue that I can use, you know, like, maybe that'll get brought up. And maybe that's something that that might work.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): This could be another option for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it could be. And then if it does work, it'll get brought rather if they do read it, it'll get brought up at the staff meeting. where everybody's at my boss, my boss's boss, Jill, everybody's there. And maybe that's a way for it to come to most attention. That deadlines being missed, affect other people in ways that you don't really know about.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): everyone will hear your complaint
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and maybe react in a way to help you maybe.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think that's, I mean, that's gotta be the way to do it. And maybe that's the best way. I really think. Yeah, I mean, after saying all that, and after going through that, I really think that that's probably the best way to do it. And if it doesn't, then I guess I can find another way. But I really think that's the best way to do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You feel as though you found an option here?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah. And even if that doesn't work, then it'll be brought up. And maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it. And maybe I'll understand really where I'm coming from. But this will at least be a start to something you know, to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff in
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your first Started with all this.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe I won't be as frustrated.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I'm feeling a little less frustrated now. Even thinking if there is another option.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah, that's,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That feels the right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Move for you. Yeah. And we'll schedule See you next week. And we can pick up from there. Sounds good. All right. Cool. Next car. Thank you.
Summary: The patient has an issue with their co worker who has not been doing their paperwork for the past couple of weeks. This annoys the patient and affects their efficiency in work productivity. The co worker is first in line and it affects everyone's work which their boss doesn't like. The patient doesn't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at their work about the situation and that is annoying too since people get mad at the patient. The patient feels stuck. They have tried to talk to the co worker Joe, but it didn't seem to work. The patient feels they are not able to find a clear plan and have exhausted all options. The patient does not know whom to complain to at the company since there is no committee and feels HR might not be of help too. The patient thinks of a complaint box with which they could pass on the complaint. They feel even if it is not resolved, it will brought up in a meeting and they will be able to discuss with their boss and a feel a lot less stressed. The patient feels better just thinking of another option. The therapist schedules following session next week.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Look, I can understand why you're worried. All right, because throwing up Blood is scary, and waking up soaked in sweat in the middle of the night. That doesn't feel either. Let me ask you a couple of questions that might help explain things. When did you have your last drink?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Actually, before I came here,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay, that was earlier this morning. All right, what did you have?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I had orange juice and I had some vodka in it. It's the only thing that steadies me enough to get out the door. I don't ever go out that often. But now,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): tell me how it helps you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's studies me studies me I'm, you know, I'm shaking all the time. I'm like,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): over the course of the day, in order to study yourself in order to feel calmer. How many drinks do you end up having?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Five? Hmm, maybe
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): singles or doubles?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't measure
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): right. is it mainly vodka
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Sometimes if I'm feeling really my stomach is really upset, I'll drink cider. that's its cider or vodka because
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): and you ever get that feeling in the morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling edgy. They need a drink to calm down. Yeah. It's the only thing that works for me. Anything that works, too. in the past week, do you think you've been drinking more?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): In the last week? Not much in the last couple of weeks maybe?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Hasn't been daily. Oh, yeah. Right. the longest you've gone without a drink in the last month would be how long?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't know. Actually. I mean, I don't know. I've got you know, I've got a lot going on. Right. Yeah. my, my sister is in Boston, she's got cancer and I know I should be calling her and I can't do that. My mom is really sick and she's horrible, and I'm the only one that Who can go see her? And I go see my mother and she yells and screams at me and she's got this email and it's
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): for all of those things, the alcohol helps.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And does it ever happen sort of by the end of the day, that you have trouble the next day remembering what happened?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess. I mean, I, you know, my days don't differ that much. But I, you know, I'll fall asleep in front of television and then I'm not seeing lots of people I you know, there's not big events in my life that I would be remembering. I just, you know, especially now that I'm feeling not well, that I
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah, there's not much that I would have to remember
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): having that. Have you tried it all to cut down on your drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I did. I did.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You know, I had a boyfriend who
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you know, was Sort of casual coming over and, and he, he said he couldn't be with me anymore because I drink too much. And I tried. I tried. I was like, Well, yeah, and then he left. who cares, right? I mean, right?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You find yourself feeling feeling guilty about the alcohol.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I feel guilty about my sister, right? I feel guilty that I can't I can't. I can't even call her I can't.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if I, if I could pull it together than I could,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): because what I understand from what you're telling me is that the drinking helps meet a certain need for you, in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on, and meets a need in terms of trying to keep you calmer. But at the same time, it's getting you into trouble. It's getting into trouble in terms of relationships, but it's also the most likely act explanation for why you've been throwing up blood isn't why the lab results that I've got are consistent with an amount of alcohol that's too much for your body to handle. Really, really, and that means, ideally, that we're going to work together to find a way to do something about it.

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. the first word is
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): structure, responsibility.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): repetition,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): repetition.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. Let me give you another word, relationship.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): conflict, power struggle.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do you see any
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): themes and in the words that you provided back
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Seems everything is really controlled and
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): structured,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): controlled and structured?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What's the source of that controlling structure? Is there a source of it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): A lot of it may come from my fiance. Now that I'm thinking about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Somebody told me you're thinking,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): because I feel that he doesn't give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the things that I would to do work, and I think he should help more with the kids around the house and do things and I shouldn't have to do everything. And I feel that's probably why I'm frustrated because I felt that I don't have any help. It's I'm single, and I'm doing everything on my own. this project where the bulk of my frustration is coming from
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance What are you feeling?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm feeling angry and disappointed. I don't really know if I want to further anything because it'd be this forever angry, frustrated
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): is a similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently. at the dry cleaner places.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's far worse than it but it's I think that's where why I'm always upset and angry.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, cuz I feel alone at the same time completely. I'm not in a fair relationship is I'm in control and I don't have freedom to do anything. I don't have help and it's it's laying a lot of stress on me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): is this is your talk about this do you feel this is new information you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it because honestly, I kind of I never really focused on that aspect of it. I kind of thought that's the way it should go. And I thought I was angry because I hate bad deeds. I've never really looked deep into it because I try hard to make everything in my family, right. I kind of really don't pay attention, I kind of ignore it. But now that I'm thinking and pointing out different things, than into how I really feel.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you feel this, this kind of big moment in terms of awareness.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Definitely because I don't think I would have I said, I think I'm kind of try to hide it and really don't focus much on it because I want things to be perfect. they got a kind of ignore it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, maybe through this session, you develop more insight about what's contributing to the anger.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely. Cuz I would go off for no reason at all and later to think about like, why did I even do it?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But But this source of anchor, this relationship, you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing? Yeah. Where's the other objects of your ad? If you weren't really sure,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I wasn't sure at all. Why. But with that, I definitely could see the reasons why.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All right, chess move. I feel we've made some progress here. And I'd you to between now and next session, if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what informations may have been revealed to you a little bit. And we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue. that's a good plan.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It's good.

And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything I was at the mall. I was hitting a lot of different stores. And I've run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to get a new dining room set tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet and he has an SUV. I called him to see if he could come in I could purchase the items but he said he wasn't he couldn't come out and I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money. Which I don't know. I don't know why he would be from me calling him but I think that's why he was concerned it but he didn't come I didn't get the dining room set or anything.

And then there were there was, I think one or two days where I went out for a walk because I was Tired of staring at the clock waiting for the 10 minutes to pass. I got up, went for a walk. And then I passed one of my friends. I ended up walking with her. And I didn't get back to my house for an hour. I kind of put it off for an hour because then I came home and took a couple hits on
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it sounds you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana. At least in most cases. It was rough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It was rough. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it was it was difficult for you, but most cases, you're able to pull off the 10 minutes. Mm hmm. That sounds there's a few instances where you're able to hold it off longer because something else kind of Yeah, came up.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I found I talked to a couple people on the phone before I knew it half hour to come by.

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Kind of Yeah. Yeah. I guess I wasn't thinking about it.

Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, not really.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Tell me about that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, it's I don't see it as a problem. It's it's legal in a lot of states now. And I mean, it's not that bad for you. It doesn't really endanger me much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you still you still believe you should have the to smoke marijuana?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I'm not hurting anybody else.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But at the same time, you want to go back to work. And if I remember, right, you're the person that you could go work for. I guess you know them right. Yeah, it's my uncle, your uncle, and you need to be cleaned for was about two months.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, two to three months.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you have kind of opposing forces here, right? You have your enjoyment of marijuana. And then you, you know, that's something you you don't wanna give up. And you believe you have a to do that. But then there's that job.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, my parents are pretty cool with it, they know. But I mean, I'm at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and move out. But I don't know. I mean, I just, it'd be nice to have that job. Like, it's a really good job, but at the same time, like, I don't see why I have to sacrifice something that I like.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it doesn't seem fair to you. But she recognizes the reality of your situation.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it's pretty accurate.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're not happy about that choice.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And kind of what we did with the postpone gratification was really ask you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that. And more, although it's difficult,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's difficult.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It's difficult for you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I asked you to track the number of times you smoke marijuana. Did you really track that over the last week?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, you remember how many times that was?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I think
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): think I
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): think it 15. Okay, between 15 and 20,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=general) (Emotion=0): between 15 and 20. And how many times did something kind of get in the way that's something else come up in that 10 minutes span that distracted you or that you enjoyed
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm like,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): almost closer to 20 times I guess, otherwise, I probably would have kept going smoke more. I mean, there were a couple times where somebody would call me or somebody would text me and that kind of distracted me and I was able to put it off for a little bit.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you can see in that 10 minutes, things can happen. things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana. Sometimes nothing does and after 10 minutes, use it. And sometimes something does kind of get in the way with a marijuana distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you didn't use.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): with that in mind
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you found the experience rough, but was it tolerable?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, Was it bad
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): was a bit Do you think for this next week? We could try postpone gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't know. That seems kinda. Yeah, that seems a longer time
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that that is definitely. That is a longer time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know about that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe 15 minutes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): no compromises. 15 Okay, do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think I could try a little bit more than 20.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All right, let's go with 15 minutes, right. 15 minutes, you know, as compared to 10. I'll give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you. And you wouldn't use that instance, right. There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives you mentioned walking right. You could use that time and start walking. Yeah. Anything else that that you like, maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana, but she didn't have anything available? What would you do instead?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): binge watch TV,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): or should it be okay, well, perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer you're delaying using marijuana, you could start watching the show.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): At the under 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show. do you see kind of how it works? is it making sense to you the postponing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier, but it's tough for you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I definitely see how helps
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And maybe if we're successful to 15?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Who knows? We'll move it up from there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe we'll see how the 15 goes, see
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): how it goes the 15? Yeah, I'll see how that goes. You know, I'm hoping. And I hope this kind of makes sense that there'll be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that use marijuana. because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities, the longer you wait. Right. The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way to speak. And probably what you'll see, you saw this last because you're, you know, you used marijuana less frequently, by waiting the 10 minutes. Even though you described as difficult I'm sure it was, but there were a few times where it kind of worked out
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): So, I think that planning something for that time would be helpful. And try to plan something 15 minutes, even if you fully intend to beyond the 15 to go and use, I think it's still useful plan something in there. You never know that might take you. Or you might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use. Okay. that's a plan.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think I can give that a try.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sounds a plan?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think we can manage that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. We'll go with that. And I'll see you next week. Okay, thank you.
Summary: Last week, postponed gratification was discussed with the patient. The patient has successfully been able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana at least in most cases roughly. There has been instances where patient even forgot marijuana. The patient feels the same towards marijuana since last session since it is legal in many states and does not hurt anybody else. However, the patient has a nice job at uncle's for which they need to be clean for two to three months.  The patient does not see why to sacrifice this for a job. The patient is requested if they can postpone gratification from 10 to 15 minutes. The patient is suggested if they can watch a show to use up time. The therapist clarifies that the patient is giving many more opportunities to interfere by longer they wait. The therapist will see the patient next week.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Um,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I've been feeling kind of in a rut. I mean, I've been looking for a job and hadn't really gotten anywhere and then the
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I had a drink the other night. And I felt
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): that me not having a job and going out and having that drink. I just, it wasn't deserved, and I felt such a loser because I should have that was the time that I should have been at work. If I had a job and instead I was at the bar drinking. I had one drink, and then Ellen two Do another because then I felt worse. And I figured I had one. come on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): how much should you drink in total?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think I lost track after four or five.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But How long had it been since you had a drink? before that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I did really well. I it was, I think three weeks,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): three weeks or so. She did really well. And then you had you had one drink. And that made you feel you weren't successful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I felt a loser
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): felt a loser.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you feel that kind of led to drinking some more. you had a rough time with things?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): what now
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, now I kind of I don't I'm afraid to go back I'm afraid to go out with, some friends. They invite me out to dinner. But I know there's alcohol. And
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): is that where you were when that first strike? was out with friends?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's a few things going on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): We've talked in the past, about separating the behavior from the person. Right? So, behavior is what we do, not who we are. You remember those discussions? And correct me if I'm wrong with sounds I'm using different words than you use. But it sounds when you had that first drink, you're kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's pretty accurate.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): That's pretty accurate. All right. taking yourself kind of back to that moment. All right, we we had that first. That first drink you finished that first drank
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What was your What was your thought at that at that moment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): shameful. I did really, really well. And then here I was. I finished a drink and I knew I wanted another one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, shameful is kind of the feeling. But the thought is I did really, really well. Right?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that's what your thinking was. I did really, really well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what? was that the end of the thought, or was that was there more before you had that next trick?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I guess I was doing well. And then I had a drink and I felt an awful person. I figured what was the hurt Having more
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): sort of sequence would have been you had to drink. You felt shameful. At the same time you're thinking that you were doing really well. And then really, as you said before, you felt a loser. And then you decided, might as have the second drink. another thought might be that, like, I might have a second drink.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah. you can see others some thoughts and some feelings at work. as you finish that first drink was a fairly quick, but those thoughts feelings fairly. occur fairly quickly after the drink.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, absolutely. As I was finishing and then finished,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): away, you regret it and that regret As you thought about it,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): don't might as continue drinking now, because you kind of blew it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I already messed up, I might as keep going.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And that's a common cycle to fall into. And you had three weeks, we hadn't had a drink prior to that. let's, let's look at this. Let's try to separate the behavior from the self a little bit. If you had if you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, you had a history of using alcohol and then at three weeks, without any alcohol use, and then their behavior was to have a drink. What would you think of them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I think that they had a rough day or something was to happen where
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, it's wondering,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I had a rough day one drink, and what would you think of their behavior? How would you categorize that behavior?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's they made a mistake.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): not ideal,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think irresponsible,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): irresponsible, but you wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a bad person.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But their behavior was a bit of responsible.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You know, in terms of the recovery plan, which would be to not drink.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But when you apply that same example examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It was my mistake it was in it. It makes me a worse person for doing it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you see how you're you're being a little bit quite a bit rougher on yourself. your your evaluation of yourself is, is fairly harsh. You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Whereas you wouldn't necessarily evaluate someone else that way.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): How would you evaluate your behavior? How would you How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): shameful. I mean, irresponsible, which is bad overall.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): So, bad, irresponsible, shameful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of in terms of your thinking, the way you evaluate it from yourself, are you into behavior?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): together a meshed or can you be separated?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think we could be separated But it, it feels we're I am that behavior
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in that moment. It's very congruent for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): the shame matches the behavior to behavior matches shame. it's there one at that moment. Mm hmm. But really, logically, rationally, you're you, Ryan, your identity and values and your behavior, something you do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But in the moment, it's hard for you to see that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm. Looking back on it now is are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah I mean, because you have one drink doesn't make you a horrible person and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): no, certainly not. And you were, you were clean for three weeks, and you had one drink. really, your behavior was a slip.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It was and irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose. But still a slip. And you could have stopped. But that shame got ahold of you. Right. I thought, well, now I've done it. I blew it. Yeah. with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more. So, I think this is important because we've seen this cycle where you have weeks of sobriety, and then we'll drink a bit and then have weeks as writing. And I'm wondering if part of the difficulty you're facing is you're not coping with the slips as slips
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than the slip. Does that make sense? That That's pretty accurate.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you see how the shameful feelings kind of interfere with the behavior that you really want that's really consistent with their goals, which would be to not continue drinking.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Another piece of this too is the association associating with friends who drink, you're putting yourself in a treacherous situation. Again, that's a behavior.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right? That doesn't make you one way or the other. It's a behavior. How would you judge that behavior going out with friends?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I mean, difficult because I being around those people. But I guess it would be it's risky.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): risky, okay. It's a risky behavior. And what does it make you Who are you? Because you do that behavior. how do you feel about yourself? When you take that risky, behavior,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): guilty,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you have guilt when you go out with your friends. And then you have shame if you drink. And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking. part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid the circumstances to recognize that's a risky behavior, which you have. And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away, right. Does that does that separation of what we do and who we are? makes sense to rationally?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): kind of
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): feels a little unnatural, though.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): maybe, as you're confronting
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): similar situations in the course of the next week, You could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk, and try to try to separate your identity from that behavior. So, judge the behavior. Okay. Right. And don't don't pass any judgment on yourself.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that makes sense.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Kind of Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It might help you to.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Since it's a little tough to because now, the feeling and the judgment, retro twined. Right. It might help to write down when these things happen, and kind of write down like, one row for this is how I judge this behavior. But I'm thinking about doing and this is how I judge myself. if you see a lot of self judgment, that might be a clue that you're falling into a cycle a little bit,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): where you're making decisions based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment and behavior.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that helped a little bit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think that would probably be beneficial.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that'll be our plan going forward.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Until next week is note document your judgment about your behavior, any judgment you may have about yourself. Right, and there's some insight that can be gained there. Right. Kind of distinguish the two and making those and try to use that evidence before making a decision to might put you in a risky spot.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sound plan?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think I can try that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, good. I'll see you next week. And we'll see how you did with those goals.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Summary: The patient feels they have been in a rut last week. They haven't gotten a job and have felt like a loser for drinking once. But the patient seems to drink more once they start since they feel like a loser. The patient is scared to go out with friends since there is alcohol. They recall a discussion with therapist saying they feel ashamed when they have the first drink. The patient feels really well but feels awful instantly after the first drink then they continue drinking as such. The patient identifies if someone else drinks after a rough day, they are a little irresponsible but not a bad person. However the patient call themselves bad, irresponsible and shameful for the same. The therapist clarifies to the patient that linking slips to shame makes the patient drink more. They act as gateways. The patient feels guilt when meeting friends and see it as risky. The therapist clarifies part of behavioral strategy is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that's a risky behavior. The patient is asked to separate what we do and who we are. The patient is asked to write these things down this week and make decisions based on rational judgement and behavior instead of emotion. The therapist will meet the patient next week.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): let's say you go into a house, you go to the community, okay? You go into a house and have an off day. Maybe worried about making mistakes, maybe stressed about that. Maybe tired. And there's some evidence there that you should be able to pick up but you you don't write somebody lies to you about what the conditions there are You kind of realize that they might not be telling the truth, but you're you're ready to get home. you leave and then somebody hurt when you have a worst case. That's the type of mistake you're afraid of making. What would that feel to make that mistake?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Terrible, it would feel like, you know, I had a role in that kind of thing happening to somebody, I was partially to blame for somebody being harmed. And that is the exact opposite of what my job is supposed to be.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): that would be a worst case outcome. You would be extremely upset. You're extremely upset now. While you're five out of 10 now, but you're an eight when you're in bed in the morning. Yeah. Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake that? This is the mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught. Is it reasonable? They continue on in the field and try to learn from that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): I don't know, I mean, I'd to think that I guess it's not possible to make that kind of mistake, but I think that that's naive. I think it is possible. And I, I would to learn from that, but I don't know what other people would do. I don't know if I would lose my job or anything.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right, there might be consequences for that type of error. It's not intentional, something that many mistakes would happen due to conflict confluence of circumstances who being tired of being the end of the day, not being honest. There's mitigation there. But still, I can appreciate you would want to make that mistake either way. What would your after making a mistake that? What would your thought be? Would you be thinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would be thinking, I don't know how this will ever be better. I don't know how I'm ever gonna feel about what I did.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): To my extension, I'll never feel about what I did. Yeah. And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I mean, I guess ideally, I would say to myself, it's going to get better. You know, this will pass and everything but I don't know. It's hard.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What do you think would do to your performance?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think I would probably Take some time off. I mean, it's I would be stressed afterwards. And worried I would make another mistake because I'm stressed out and having trouble focusing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you're having now that result in anxiety, are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): Yeah, I mean, I guess I never thought about it that, although that makes a lot of sense. it. If I, if I calm down and try to let it go, then I'll do my job better and I won't have that risk as much. But if I keep feeling this, I'm not focusing and then I could make a bigger mistake because of it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Right, one of the thoughts you're having now is you can't make a mistake because it would be too devastating. And that titles this. I have a thought you're having. it's you can't make a mistake. And this is leaving you emotionally less prepared and probably increased risk of making a mistake.
Summary: The patient is afraid that somebody lies of the situation and somebody is hurt in the worst case. The patient feels partially to be blamed and are extremely upset. After making a mistake, the patient doesn't know if they every gonna feel okay of what they did. It's hard. The patient feels stressed afterwards of making a mistake and wishes to take some time off. The therapist asserts the anxiety would leave the patient at more risk to make a mistake.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hi you how to do it today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Great. How are you?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you're doing great.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm doing awesome.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I know your brother brought you in today and he had expressed some concerns about your mood. Do you know what that's about?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I, I think he's worrying for no reason. Because I, you know, I for the last week and a half, I have been following my passion, which is baking. And I didn't realize this before, because I worked in an office. And I realized that that's not what I want to do with my life. And I know what I want to do with my life now, and I've never known before. this is an amazing feeling. And what I want to do is I want to start my own baking business. And what happened was That a couple. Two weeks ago, my nephew had a bake sale. And I've always I've always been baking, but I've always been from the box or from, you know, whatever. I tried for the first time making brownies from scratch and they were amazing and everyone loved them at the bake sale and they sold out. And my nephew thought I was a hero, basically, I was and now it made me realize I could do this for a living and it would make me feel amazing and make me feel a hero for all these people. And my college campus would be kind of cool if I could put up something about delivering the bakery the dorms or big goods to dorms because you know, college students love that type of thing. But anyway, I was thinking about long story short, having this business and I would bake all these cookies and I was gonna put up flyers because I don't I'm not at the point where I can get an office space but I don't need an office space because I have my apartment and I have everything I need in my apartment to bake everything I need. And I can also have a BJs membership. Go to BJs. And I can get everything I need in bulk. all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff. it's not an issue if I do it from my apartment. And I was putting up flyers and trying to promote my business and has really been working on for the last week and a half, and I feel great. And it's amazing. And that's it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, you feel like, everything's kind of going your way. Hmm. And you're really excited about the new business idea. I know that your brother was a little concerned with how much you've been spending on the business idea. And he mentioned some things about different relationships you've had that are new.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, there's a couple that with that. with the spending, I don't think my brother recognizes that when you start a business you need to invest in it to begin, and I understand why he's worried because like, at work at the office job that I had, I got in trouble and because I obviously you need to make fires and I was like, oh, he doesn't realize I'm frugal. I'm smart. I was I'll make the fires at work. And put them out of the work computer. that I'm not having to pay like, wherever, staples or something to go and print them out for me. I got in trouble because it was for personal use, and I was using the, the work, whatever. But that's what annoys me about it because the new guy that I met, which is the other thing with the relationships, this new guy is supportive of my ideas. I met him in a bakery, which is destiny. And he was supportive when I told him about what I was planning. And the other guy that I was talking to before, and I've been talking to him for a while, he was kind of my brother and was like, are you sure this is something you want to do? And like, I don't understand why you would say that someone who's obviously sure of what they want to do. Like, I know I can do it. I know that I'll be successful, like, did they not taste the brownies at the bake sale? they were amazing. And that's kind of where I am and that's why my brother's worried but he shouldn't be because I have all this played out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): He's worried that you don't want to think this was the new relationship you don't know the guy too
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, I've hooked up with him a few times, I know him pretty well. And I don't think he understands the connection that we have, I guess a pretty strong one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your brother doesn't. In your mind, he doesn't get it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No. And like, he doesn't like, pay attention to me when I talk. Like, I'll be trying to tell him about, the bake sale and or not the bake sale. Well, a little bit about the bake sale, I can try to tell him about how successful it was. And he thought that I was like, bragging, but I wasn't it was genuinely, a success. And then I tried to tell him about my business idea. And like, he's like, trying to brush it off. it's not a good idea. And that's why he doesn't listen to me. sometimes I try not to talk too much about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Have you noticed through all this, any change in sleep patterns?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I haven't been sleeping as much but I think that's because I'm excited about this and so. I've been staying up late and waking up early and looking at recipes, and honestly hasn't really been an issue because I haven't been tired at all. I was really The I haven't eat I felt rested. I get enough.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Notice you do feel rested. You haven't been sleeping as much.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you clearly seem you're in a good mood No, no sadness now at that,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm not gonna have sadness when you're following your passion
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): should be doing pretty that way. Have you ever been down or depressed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah. In the past I have been actually, not too long ago, about four months ago I was I was hospitalized because I was down. But, you know, and I, I don't feel that now. And I know what it feels to be down and I don't have any of that stuff. I feel much more hopeful and happy and great with where my life is going now.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you ever feel this way before? kind of in a really good,
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): no
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No. Nothing this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What do you think about all this one?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Honestly I think it's getting to know myself and getting to know what I want to do which is this you know, culinary arts
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it's kind of realizing that it's kind of changed my life
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): for the better for really for the better
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right, and you mentioned before that you got some trouble at work
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): right? How bad that turned out
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): pretty bad I it was a final written notice if any little thing at this point could make me lose my job but I'm not too worried about it because at this point I'm putting much time into the baking business that if something goes wrong with my office job, I'll have this in I'm sure that in as short as a month I'll, I'll be making money soon. And a lot of money because I know how much time I'm going to be putting into this how passionate I am about it. And I know that I'll be able to make the money back that I've put into it. I'm not worried about it
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): shouldn't have to worry about that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And are there any other things that you worry that people will notice?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think obviously the shaking I think my hands and legs shaking and kind of going really red and sweating and looking great. went ahead.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it sounds you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations. Yeah. You say you go read you shake. Is there anything else that you think that you do? I mean, describe yourself. How do you think you look, when you're in these situations,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): like, I think I looked really obviously weird and out of place and really read and visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage these problems?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And I guess when I'm holding the camera, I grip onto it really, really tight, or kind of clench on my muscles and find something that I can focus on. And to kind of try and make myself shake less and not goes red and stuff.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you focus on something you grip onto that Camera. Do you make eye contact with people?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No. I tend to look down.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you also avoid eye contact? Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating For example,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I as I kind of looking down and wearing all black, it's less obvious and what kind of worrying? Yeah, more layers and all black says you can't tell.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things? If you stopped gripping onto the camera? Or, you know, you start to make eye contact and not looking down? And what do you think would happen?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think it would be much worse. Yeah, I think I would check even more and be more anxious and look of more obviously, kind of weird and out of place.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And what I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work, okay? And if we did this maybe twice and the first time, you do all the things that you normally do, and grip onto something, look down. And is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations, these work conversations to try and cope.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And I kind of all fumble and kind of clench, whatever, whatever it is, I'm holding really tight and make sure I don't make any eye contact at all, kind of get through it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, in the first time, I want you to do those things as much as you normally would, in fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would.

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have, that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work, and who should I play if you're playing yourself in this roleplay? Who should I be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): maybe a client at work? I always have to sit down with clients before we did the shoe and kind of get to know a little bit more about what they want.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that's all for now. Thank you much for your time
Summary: The patient worries a lot when in social situtations, visibly shake, red and sweating. The patient tries to clench on their muscles and find something to focus on or look down and they prefer wearing black to be less obvious of worrying. The therapist requests the patient for a role-play of these situations to be enacted. On enacting the patient rates 90 on 100 for all her symptoms by doing those things she normally would. The patient believes they are going to do a lot worse if they don't do things they normally do to cope with their anxiety. After enacting, the patient feels much better and rates less than 30 for visibly shaking, less than they thought for going red, less than 10 for being stupid, less than 10 for visibly sweating. The patient felt much better and looked more natural after watching themselves in the video when they weren't doing any of those coping up things.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. For the past, past, maybe a couple weeks, I guess few weeks. I have these morning meetings once a week at work, and I have to make a presentation. And every time I go to present, it's my turn and I start getting. Start getting really nervous.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Start getting really nervous. your morning meeting at work. And does each person at the meeting present in like, a row?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, we all take turn,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): they'll take turns. And when you start to feel nervous, when it's your time to talk or before or after that, and now
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'm usually the guy at the start of the meeting, because I know I'm gonna have to, there's about 10 of us and I always seem to be one of the last few to go like, six or seven, kind of in line to present
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): says around 10 people at the meeting. Yeah. And and as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end. can you describe what's happening say for the beginning of the meeting, in terms of what you're experiencing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Hmm. Sowhen I walk in, I'm usually and you know, say good morning to everybody and then my my boss calls means order. And that's usually when it starts, kind of starts like, maybe butterflies in my stomach kinda. And then after he makes his report, and then it starts going around the room and my heart starts to be faster, my palms get sweaty, and I just, I start to feel really nervous. I've realized that I might be kind of I start to tune out some of the other presentations. Because I, I start to become focused on how I'm feeling.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And I focused focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you're not really hearing what they're saying.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): they're saying,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): all right. go on. these you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness, what happens and
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): By the time it it's my turn to present I start. I just, I'm almost almost shaking. Yeah, I noticed that my hands are a little little off. And keep my hands down, in my lap and that. I don't want anybody to see them shaking that. And I have a paper in front of me that I kind of read from. But when I start reading my my voice is a little shaky, and I kind of stutter and tripped over my words. And I I feel I'm not making good presentations and then it's not looking good to my boss.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, in the moment when you're when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness that doesn't that doesn't go away at all. And you're trying to hold your body kind of still. almost a cube control.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah. And then your voice This kind of sounds crackly or breaking up as you're trying to read from like, bullet points wanna?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): an outline?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What happens when you have read the last read last point?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): when I'm done it's it takes a little bit for everything to calm down. But I I'm, then I'm consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he's, you know, he's regretting putting me in this position and that I can't make good records or you know that I didn't report the stuff the information to him and and so, it doesn't really go away. It it's almost my mind is shift someone I'm anxious about.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Alright, then the nervousness that's stronger feeling of nervousness that goes away, is replaced by a more general feeling. nervousness about how your how your boss will think of you. Yeah. Because of the presentation quality.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that. And you're aware of that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How How long have you noticed? This, these symptoms that appear in this way.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, when you when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time, and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations. And I just, I mean, most people are afraid of public speaking half out that maybe that's what it was. you know, doing a presentation in front of 30 something people and it didn't really didn't really bother me letters. I figured it was normal and always got you know, decent grades. On my presentation it never really bothered me. I really feel it's only been an issue in the last few weeks.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): The last few weeks is when you notice that we had we had some nervousness before presenting in college but you kind of thought of it as normal generally impair your ability to present an effect your grades or anything right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um I'm not sure if it if it has any bearing. My my mom, she, she I know she doesn't to speak in public. And I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations. School and, you know, shoots Oh, you can buy it on. It's tiny. And, you know, I don't know if that means anything.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): whatever you have going on, you think that maybe, maybe she has that going on to
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): maybe
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): the same, same set of symptoms, at least.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, I've asked her, you know, I've told her about this. And she hasn't been in a situation where she's had to, to do this kind of presentations, in a small group this. And I don't, I can't compare it to that. But I mean, she has said that she's gotten nervous before.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Any feelings of sadness or anything that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, after I do after I make the presentation at work, and then I do start feeling really sad.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, no, I've I've managed to control it, I guess to where I can stay there. I said, I've kind of zoned out some times when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I'd become focused on on on what's going on inside my heart eating and the you know, my hands and I can't I zone out on them sometimes, but But no, I I pushed through it and I do my presentation.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Today
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I've been working still on the fear of leaving the home for extended periods of time vacation. And it's been a little harder recently because I have this plan trip with a friend of mine coming up in a few months and that's kind of been weighing on my mind.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Whereas the trip to?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Georgia

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): she wants to go six days Yeah, I'm not sure with work and school and everything I can make the full six days and plus I'm a little nervous to go that long.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that's a long time for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It is yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): when did you discover this trip was going to be
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): last a few days ago, she messaged me and said, Hey, you want to go with me and we'll go golfing and swimming. I love golfing. Like, I know I want to go. But I had these a little nervous about leaving
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): a little nervous? when she made that call,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I was a couple days ago, was the first thought he had kind of I can't go that long. That was my first thought. That's, that's too long. But he was like, wow, this would be great. I want to go down there golfing bad and get away from the cold weather. I mean, my immediate thought was no, not that long. But yes, I'm gonna go.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, to kind of conflicting thoughts, right. one, one is like, never go that long, six days, way too long. And the other one is that would be enjoyable. You enjoy that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Absolutely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. which way you're leaning now.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I want to go to go for six days. Maybe a long weekend
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 3, 4 days?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): two would be ideal but the idea of it two three days Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): what we think is causing this worry about being gone more than two days?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I mean, I've always as a late teenager in my 20s I've always had nervous to leave home I don't as much as I love being home I love to travel to and you know, do different things. It's just, I guess I'm afraid something to happen when I'm not around.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Not to you're afraid something will happen to your, your house or,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): well, I have pets we're about them. My parents are getting older, I worry about them. Mainly, my immediate family, mainly, I guess my dad, because he's had a history of heart attacks and then my pets that's such as for something to happen, I will be there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And how about when you were younger? You said this Problems found for was the same thing, the same thing. mostly family and now some pets,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): my pets then to see if that's
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yes, your feelings are there fighting one another. Absolutely. And now the feeling the thought anyway, have you know I would to go on the trip. is winning But the fear thought was kind of dragging, dragging you down. Yeah. what's the sensation of anxiety here?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I get anxious. Yeah, my heart gets feels it's heavy my chest feels heavy and I all these thoughts go through my mind like, you know, I know my parents um I can watch my pets but they may not take care of them I would I don't know it's I mean that you know they've always will take care of all my no but they'll miss me and they might tear my house up I don't all these thoughts in my mind that seem crazy to me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it seems an endless stream of worries. Yeah. Surrounding family and pets. And what might happen. really, that's that's it, right? This is what might happen. It's the uncertainty, right? is anything ever happened?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, no
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. far all worrying. And anxiety really hasn't paid me dividends.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yes. And now that I'm older when I was younger, I probably wouldn't it overnight. But now that I'm older yes, I do I say, I got to live my life and they'll be okay. I try to tell myself they're in good hands. If something happens somebody Oh, call me but then I feel oh, but I want to be hours away. I'm a plane ride away. And then I get thinking about that, but I do go.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you didn't in the past
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): no
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): something changed. What changed?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know.I really
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): right? not sure what change but used to not go, now you do go. when you're down there, or wherever you go in the trip, you're feeling better, you're enjoying yourself. But you're also worried at the same time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Not too well. Once I get there, I'm usually okay. Maybe the first night I get a little worried. And then maybe when I'm getting ready to come home, I'm a little anxious, I'm ready to get home to make sure everything's okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And the rest of the time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'm usually Okay. I'll get some alcohol involved. he kind of limits my anxiety. But once I get into playing the golf and all that, I really do allow myself to enjoy it. It's it seems it's going and coming. That's
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): alright, the problem really isn't when you're there. The problem is now leading up to it and maybe the first half day, your day when you're there, and maybe the last half day or two there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It's a plane. I don't have a problem, right, flying out. But it's the thinking like, while I'm waiting for the plane like, Whoa, what if we What if a terrorist is on there? What if we crash? I'll think about all that before, but once I'm there and on the plane is right, take off. I'm fine. I'm completely fine. not anxious. It's leading up to the actual event that makes me anxious.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I suppose anticipation. that's that's the worst part. All right, the period between now when you leave, it's gonna be the worst part.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but she'll probably stock up.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Probably. But I'll have changed my mind probably a dozen times before say yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And when you do go on Twitter.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): something could happen. Certainly sure. But it Hasn't far
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I try not to think that for
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): alright, you'll, you'll return?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Still doesn't stop me from worrying when I get these trips planned.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, the probabilities of it really doesn't. That doesn't alleviate the Worry, worry still there. Right. Even though you know the worry is probably going to transition to enjoyment and looking forward to that that doesn't
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No not at all
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that doesn't leave anything at all.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I gotta get my house cleaned up and make sure my animals or everyday have enough food and I preparing to leave.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Preparing is productive, right? Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Well, how would the thoughts see you feel more connected to the warring?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Probably like, like, I want to, I want to say, I don't know I really it's kind of a word. I want to, I can't say bye Not to my parents or I can't, you know, say bye enough to my pets I feel I I don't I don't know, I don't really care. That's, I guess part of the problem. I don't know what I'm connecting it to.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you don't tell them goodbye enough time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I don't know, maybe I sound so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Oh, it sounds maybe if you don't say if you don't say goodbye enough times and settled that, that you'll feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that that's the focal point of this thing's night in some way. Right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Let me go for a few days.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And the way you start to let go is when you tell them
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what do you find yourself doing? You say goodbye and then then leave and then come back? Or
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): do I finally say, bye? I'll talk to you later love you. You know, I'll check in when I land or whatever and then that's it. Then it's like, I have to try to breathe and put those thoughts behind me. Because once I say it, it's like, Okay, that's it. I'm gone.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): But you're but your thoughts are still coming thoughts are still come in and say, You should have said, goodbye one more time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No. I know that doesn't come to my mind
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that you didn't say goodbye enough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): The property was the property of saying goodbye. This you feel you're not doing enough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Maybe it's the fact that I'm leaving. I shouldn't leave. say that, you know, maybe I feel I maybe it's the guilt of leaving.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the act of leaving itself Leave shoot guilty. And what are you guilty of?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Not being there if something happens.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): abandon
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): for a short time neglecting them for a short time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Probably maybe I did feel a little guilty.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And now you're in more of a caregiver role than you were then.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Maybe a little bit I mean, I've always been. I'm the youngest of mine, me and my sister, but my parents have always looked up to me to be the responsible one and make sure everything's taken care of I probably kind of loud myself. To take on that role of the caregiver moreso or be at the more responsible one of the two.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to be the responsible one, there needs to be guilt when you leave, I guess
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): maybe I should stay home and be responsible person and they don't make me feel guilty. They say go have a good time. Your baby's ugly. Okay, we'll take care of what I mean. I know they're in good hands. That's that's what's makes it difficult. I know they'll be okay. But I feel a probably shouldn't go.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's not another person driving the skill towards you. That's me. coming in from the side.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if I, if I leave, well, I'm responsible. And if I leave, something bad will happen. And that'll be on me.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now when they're to fix it, or take care of it or make it better, I put it on somebody else that have to do with that. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): fear of being caught as irresponsible.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Maybe Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you could be a few left to take you a day's travel or whatever, however far away.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. yeah, but that's that's still doesn't help relieve anxiety now when you come back, because
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): no, not really. Because it's like, I want immediate access. Like, I want to be able to be there within minutes if they need me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you ever taken a trip that was within
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, not it's not as bad but yeah, there's back there. Stay with us. For an overnight there's some of the way up sometimes I'm thinking I should stay home. Or I could be in the same town sometimes that if I'm, I wake up at five in the morning, I get up and go home because I get really start feeling really anxious and I want to be home.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): the closer you are, it helps a little bit, it sounds a good part of the anxiety is still there. it really doesn't matter where you go. It's the fact that you're not home. The fact that you're not able to fully be responsible in the way that you view it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): When I work 12 hour shifts and I have to work the overnight I will most of the time Take my break and go there between the chuck on Pima Benson.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): at 20 that's a long shift. a 20 hour shift. At what point do you become anxious when did when you start to notice those thoughts?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Probably usually six, seven hours into it depends now it's getting dark when it kind of gets dark and If I don't leave the light on or something, I get a little anxious. I feel I need to go home and leave the light on and, you know, let my pets know I'm coming back kind of weird, but I know they miss me. And then but if I'm busy, then I don't really think about it. if you know if I'm busy at work, doing something I don't really think about until I stop what I'm doing right, slow down and I'm thinking, wow, I got 10 more hours or eight more hours. Sometimes I go home, sometimes they don't. Sometimes it's worse than others.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): if you're busy at work, the same reality exists, meaning your pets are alone. But the way you're responding to it is different. Yeah, you're less anxious.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Maybe because I know I'm close. I can get there. I know I'm in control. We'll be able to go there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, I'm buddy let's say not at work, let's say when you're on the vacations in those days in the middle when you're enjoying yourself. Is that a distraction the more you enjoy yourself the last year
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): But the same reality exists there alone. really, it's your way ofwhich way of viewing things that's leading to anxiety. It's not necessarily what's happening.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's my perception,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your perception of what's happening. What could happen. I guess in this case, not much what is happening is what you worried. could could
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): definitely,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): because nothing's happened yet.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No, not yet.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, how many? Well, there's I guess there's a few different. There's a few different issues here. Right? How many vacations you take a year.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't really take long vacations I've taken only I've only taken two week long vacations ever. For like, five, six days, and I was fine. Well, same anxiety when I was younger. And now it's more long weekends or you know a night here or there I don't really take long vacations but probably maybe three or four times a year I'm go away overnight versus not a friend's house an actual vacation where I go into the city or something
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): sort of small proportion of the time looking in terms of probabilities you risk is very low because you're not quite that much. But the other issue is that even at work you're still having the same feelings and even for short trips you're still have the same feelings. you're really limiting things xietymuch of the time
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, '
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it's been this way for years
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): probably since a teenager and he hasn't stopped me I've always where every now I work more than ever I'm the more it doesn't stop me from working the kind of overtime working three jobs doesn't stop me and but I mean, I said in as a teenager early 20s it did I would be like, on my way out somewhere to go stay the night my boyfriend was like, Nope, I can't do it not to come home. But now that doesn't happen. And may not I may not go for a week long vacation, but I'll go for a few nights.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're functioning?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, yeah. '
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Approved. Yeah, he's pretty good. working a lot sounds
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Because this uncomfortable anxiety. This is painful for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, it doesn't it doesn't really seem to stop me from working obviously, because I work it's the leading up to leaving for work or
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): going on vacation. Alright, let's say
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): think about making sure I have everything I need for work, you know, don't have, I usually take my dinner.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Do you feel less anxious when you With those prevention, okay, that helps. Right? physically preparing your house that your pets are safer that helps you. what else is going through your mind you do that you take all the precautions you can to keep them safe and prepare your dinner for work and everything. what's the next thought?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): gotta go to work. I think about I'll come home later. You know if I get a break. I mean usually I do especially if I do the overnight as I got downtime, run home and check on and then I'm off to work and then I kind of forget about it. And then I said some lights is burned out not every night I come home and check off but some nights I get started feel anxious and get thinking about them and I go on the trip.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): every time when you felt anxious and you wanted to check on them, but you couldn't leave
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): for now from out working with clients. Yeah, what
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): happens then terms of thinking and feeling?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't dwell on it because my focus is with the client. it kind of think about it, I need to get home but you know, and I focus back on the client, I don't let it overwhelm me or
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, it doesn't change your function, but society has their anxiety associated with
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it goes away. I mean, I want what I'm thinking about, but then it goes away.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Alright, depending on what you're thinking about, that can change the level of anxiety you're experiencing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): there's something or Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, there's that is the that is the thought you're having something that
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): about older cats. I mean, he's really old something cool. You know what if, you know he's, something's happened to hell I mean, I don't honestly thinking I'm dying, but I think you know what he needs because he has he's really old. I do think about him.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I still have that you have that thought like,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you can see the power of thinking and all this right. the reality of your cat's health and being hasn't changed the way you view it, as change the way you think about it. we talked about before this idea of the adaptive response, right? the thoughts you're having now that lead to the anxiety, we believe could lead to anxiety. They're automatic, right? They're popping in your head. Right? It's triggered by certain things, getting ready to leave for work and, and being at work while and look at the time and realizing something. We have the cats, right. But that's an automatic that comes without, like, you can't necessarily stop right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): comes naturally when I'm getting ready to leave.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Then the anxiety is there. the adaptive response, we also call self talk. That's, that's a thought that you can give that you can create consciously. Right? You can think to yourself, it's not automatic. It's not an adjustment of an automatic thought. It's a thought that you can deliberately think Almost repeating a sentence that you've memorized, you can at will choose to do that. That makes sense. I want to make sure I draw the distinction. Some thoughts pop in. Other thoughts you deliberately, like, when we found is if you have a thought that you deliberately think we call the adaptive response. It can counter the feelings caused by the automatic thoughts, essentially.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're challenging, you're disputing that automatic thought, this be my own thoughts.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You're spinning your thoughts. Yeah. So, you know, and I want you to work with me to develop these adaptive responses. I want you to have most of the site all the sites you want and because I think that you can develop ones that are useful to you, but to give an example when you haven't thought that You know, the older cat can be sick, right? And adaptive response could be or could be wide, wide variety of thoughts, but one could be it's not likely. Right? Like, you know, or if it is likely that you know, he'll probably be okay. If it's a he or she, okay? He'll probably be till I get home. Another adaptive response could be it would be sad and unfortunate something happened. But I have my work responsibilities and at some point I have to leave the cats alone.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I do tell them that I tell them thank them and I feel them that does someone want sometimes I run from me when I try to kiss them goodbye. And I'm like, Oh, no, what I have to go to work because you will have to eat. I know it sounds silly, but I do tell him that and then I kind of thinks it does. Most things. I think I didn't realize that's kind of what I was. But I do do that sometimes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you're actively responding.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, but I didn't realize that's what I was doing. But yeah, I do say that to myself to them. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I think that's a productive, adaptive response. I mean, you know, you're right. If you don't, if you don't earn income, then they'll have worse problems.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I can't take care of them being left alone.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): really good working. You're, you're being more of service to them and protecting them more
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's true. I never thought of it that way.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that might be one adaptive response you may want to consider applying when you have this, this feeling of anxiety
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and then there's times I think, you know, they're cats are probably the last to go on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): they're not striking you as anxious when you get home.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Well, sometimes sometimes sometimes after a 12 hour shift, yes, I have one of them. She won't show me let me sleep the first hour, she were around again and stuff. And I take it and she's mad because I've been gone, but she's fine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): She continues to survive, despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving. that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring a mild stressor. But sometimes they're asleep when you get home.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, that's true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how bad could it be for them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And they don't know. I'm worrying or anxious. They could care less they don't believe no, it's not bothering them. I mean,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah, I mean, their level awareness clearly different than than yours. Right. yeah, I mean, that's another good adaptive response that, you know, much higher level awareness, whereas you're not sure that Have any awareness that you're experiencing anxiety? Or maybe a little bit with a one cat who runs or think they do?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And that's an animal person but I think they do but yeah, I probably give them think they have more feelings than what they probably really do. But they're my kids I treat them as kids my kids are all gods are important too. Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): absolutely. it's understandable that you would be anxious and have concerns and but it also seems you did make preparations to elevate their chances of having a successful experience being okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you implement behaviors that are practical and that I've worked in making the house safe and keeping the plants away from them and I think one route here if you're with it would be to use work as the first point I know you have the trip. I know that's, that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst But you have more chances? Well, one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because it's more or less a daily thing, right? five days a week, or whatever it is. some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together, right? You could apply those. And you know, think about that the responses are not always short. Right? The automatic thoughts could be short. It can even be images, do not necessarily even complete sentences, right? maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation. it's not necessarily spelled out in English, a sentence, but adaptive responses. Well, they could be images too, but the ones I'm talking about are really sentences that you're repeating back consciously to yourself. it's important to have them prepared and ready to go. I often ask clients To kind of write them out and have them available. that when that thought comes about, and it seems you're pretty good at identifying, you know, what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you've memorized initially you'd read the automatic thought I mean, the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought. Okay, might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and I found that it changes how often and how intense to aback thoughts come in. Conscious thinking, adaptive responding, does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's us. Because I said, I kind of said these things to myself anyway, I didn't realize that's what was probably lessening the anxiety because I do say that things those things to myself pretty frequently when I say I have to go to work, or else you guys won't be able to take care of didn't even dawned on me that that's
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you've already adapted Yeah, you've already used cognitive behavioral techniques, in a way to reduce anxiety. what we're really doing is expanding and formalizing what you've already been doing to achieve some success.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That makes sense. Definitely, yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): So, if you could, between now and next session, write down some of the adaptive responses that we discussed the ones you've already used and, and then work to identify the automatic thoughts at work, and then come up, work to identify them, and then consciously repeat those, those that the responses back when you have those thoughts, okay, you're really repairing self talk, adaptive responses, with the automatic thoughts, that thought comes right? And then you have the adaptive response. And you're repeating it, you know, it's an internal, you're pitting and thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud, although, that would surely be to not know, your coworkers, you know, respond something that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sorry. No. I mean, I've threatened to put a camera in the house. I can like, there's a thing you can, you can remote access to your house, and there's a button your animal can push and call you. And I've talked to him at work. I'm like, Well, my cat calls me y'all. I really thought about it seriously, that I could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home, I could look in and see what they're doing. I have thought that some of my co workers know I can't worry about them. yeah, they would help support me and not be anxious. Probably.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And and putting in a security type measure. You could lessen anxiety, or it could create anxiety,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): but make it worse,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): and I don't know which, you know. I think if you're with it, we'll start with the adaptive responses.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I'd rather do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): See how that works out. And we have other options. Putting security systems in such to shy out in the future if necessary. Let's try the adaptive responding. Then trying to keep track of how it works for you like, what your what your thoughts and feelings were. After you applied it,
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): should I try to measure my level of anxiety? Absolutely. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. you know, maybe a one to 10 with 10 being the worst, okay, and measure it when you first had that experience of it. I'm pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately, you've experienced it for a long time. You suffer with it for a long time. And then after applying the adapter response, especially after a few minutes, applying a few times, maybe shoot for ones, see what it is that and note that, again, the beginning of might not see much of a change at all. Right? be persistent with it. Okay. Give it a chance to work and see how it does. Okay. We'll start there and we'll kind of review how you do that. And then we'll work toward the things Analyze the bigger stressor right? And we'll see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that. Okay. a good plan. Yes.
Summary: The patient has difficulty leaving home for extended periods of time like vacation. The patients explains a scenario where they are seen to have conflicting thoughts of to go and not to go. The patient has parents and pets to take care of. The patient gets worried if something might happen to them when they are away. The patient feels less anxious if they are busy at work since they can reach home but not the same during a vacation. The therapist confirms, depending on what the patient thinks, it can change the level of anxiety. The therapist advises to use self talk to overcome automatic thoughts of anxiety and discusses adaptive responses useful to the patient. The patient is asked to develop different adaptive responses and read the upside of adaptive response to counter the automatic thought and is requested to try this week and note the adaptive responses down. The therapist also request the patient to measure their anxiety levels.

<PrimaryTopic: anxiety> <SecondaryTopic: classroom-presentation> <GlobalEmotion: -0.34>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hi, Hazel Hey doing today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. Yeah. I know when we met last time for your intake. You were concerned about some presentations that you had to give at school. Yeah. And you want to talk about that today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Yes. So, in school. I am in school for teaching. And we have to give presentations a lot as you can imagine, on different things and it's something that's recurring. And what happened was, I gave a really bad one one time. My way of presentation. Yeah, I wasn't feeling very well. And I gave, I think I was really tired from studying all night and I gave a really bad presentation. And then now ever since, when I've tried to give subsequent presentations, I'm nervous, and I'm up there sweating and starting to forget what I'm gonna say. And I'm like, a fear of, of getting up there and having to get a presentation because I feel I'm gonna bomb it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, was there a time for like, recently when you had to give presentations?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, like, before and earlier in my life, I'm towards the end of my degree. you know, throughout program I have.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How would you consider those?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=1): pretty well, I mean, I consider myself a pretty good student. normally I do pretty well, it seemed to, you know, come out of nowhere.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this presentation you gave with that received a poor score, maybe it was an isolated incident.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I was saying I wasn't feeling very well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But that experience has still led to a lot of things anxiety with subsequent presentations,
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): oh, yeah. Like, I'm worried about my grades suffering as a result. And you know how long I'm going to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. So, would it be if we kind of step through the whole process of giving a presentation
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sure. All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety? now or other times are really in that moment when you're presenting?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Mostly. It's most intense in that moment. And maybe leading up to it, in preparation that I know that this is going to happen. Like, I always know when I'm going to present like, it'll be the teacher will say, Oh, well, you know, your this Thursday, someone else's next Thursday. the closer it gets to that event, the more anxious I am, in anticipation.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you start feeling anxiety. A few days before presentation?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I would say a few days mostly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When does it start to get really distressing for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): two days before or one day before that? I'm like, Oh, my gosh, like, Am I ready? what if I mess up? You know what if Get a bad grade all these what ifs.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, would you be if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of the presentation? Alright, let's what's one of the classes you're taking now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): early childhood,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): let's say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now. I have a normal presentation. Yeah. All right. So, Let's now move to two days out, where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it. Yeah. What's going through your mind at that two day out point?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Um, I would say like, Am I prepared enough? Like, did I do enough?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. your thought is, did I do enough preparation?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Yeah. Which leads to maybe I did is what I'm really thinking like, I'm not prepared enough as I should be.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): that's that's the thought you're having 40 hours before the presentation. I'm not prepared enough. And kind of thinking about that thought. And what happens afterward? Do you have a reaction any type of emotional, affective, affective reaction to that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): at that point, I'm usually like, more anxious, maybe irritable a little bit. Mostly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And that goes substantially unchanged that feeling for how long?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'm The day before it kind of gets more intense when I'm nitpicking like, well, I forgot this or I didn't forget this and, you know, remembering what happened last time when I didn't do and worrying about my grade, more thoughts pop in my head of things that I forgot or what if sort of things.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right, the same type of thought more intense, more intense and the feeling is also more intense.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Summary: The patient is in school for teaching and they have to give presentations on different things. Once they gave a really bad presentation and ever since they have been nervous for subsequent presentations thinking they are going to bomb it. The patient has given presentations comfortably earlier in life and this is just an isolated incident as confirmed by the therapist. They fear if their grades are going to suffer. The patient says it is most intense in the moment that leads up to presentation, in anticipation. The patient starts to feel anxious a few days before and the most distressing moment is two or one day before. The patient feels their fear just before the days leading up to the presentation day, say 40 hours before is if they had prepared enough or they forgot something. Then they feel a little bit anxious and irritable. Towards the end, they nitpick, worry about grade and ask what if sort of things.

Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You'd rather not be doing it at the last moment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, I mean, I try not to. I mean, I set time aside to go sit down. I'm like, Alright, you know, we're gonna start on this paper. Then sidetracked. I'm watching TV. I'm on my phone. I'm on some other website.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): these these activities that you're engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing, also regarding the references before you start writing. You said check an email.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And other kind of sounds unplanned small activities.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, there's small things that keep My attention but it's not where my attention needs to go.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): These aren't particularly engaging activities something you need to do. No at that moment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No I mean, I look up you know, I started one reference and then who this article looks cool who this article you know next thing I'm know I'm researching octopuses or something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): distracted,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah distracted at work.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And then there's a moment you kind of catch yourself and realize you haven't really started writing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, but it's two hours late
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): is too late. Yeah, you're consuming time there. Alright. you have a few different levels of activity. Here you have the paper, which it sounds you're writing but you're you're maybe not highly motivated to write.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): but you seem to be getting the references done. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I get some references done. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You collect the material, and then the writing part. That's the difficult part. And then you have these behaviors. In the middle, which you enjoy doing a little, but they're not something that
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, they're not something I'm am jumping for joy about it's something to to procrastinate. I don't have to do my paper. And I don't think that I you know, I'm not like, Oh, I need to check my email I don't have to do my paper. It's just, Oh, I should check my email. Oh, I should check my phone. Oh, I haven't done this one Oh, I haven't seen this in a while.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): But these behaviors still fulfill purpose they they do delay the writing of the paper.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You may not be fully aware of that in a moment. But then you kind of become aware of that later that that's the purpose that those behaviors accomplished was that they kept you distracted from writing. Alright. the the writing of papers and activity, that's a behavior that's something you're not really looking forward to. What's the behavior That was an activity that you really do look forward to, you know, think about and some level of engagement is there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, there is this new TV show out that they started a new season. And I have it all recorded, 24 episodes. But I can't find time to watch it. But I'm really, you know, I've seen the first season I'm interested in it. And I'm can't wait to see the next one. I guess that that would that's, I guess what makes me really happy now.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you're excited about this television show and you how you have the episodes already recorded. And maybe one of the reasons you can't find the time is because the time you're using between the two parts of writing this paper.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, this paper is taking me a lot longer than it should.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right. let's let's try this. When you when you do write to paper, you're really writing it. The writing part, not the preparing part, but the writing part kind of all at the end. Right, getting it done this the night before it's due. All right. I want to try a couple different behavioral strategies here. Okay. And these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation. One is I think that it might be helpful and I want you let me know if I'm here to break if it's a five page paper to break it up into more than one night. Because now, functionally, at least a lot of what you're doing on the last night, okay. would be a more comfortable pace Like, for example, how long does it take you to write one page?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): out an hour, hour and a half?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): around an hour to an hour and a half? You can complete one page. Edited proof read?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. it would take about five days. To complete the whole paper, if you did an hour and a half each day, an hour to one I haven't checked. Okay. But how much time do you have from when the papers assigned to when it's due?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): They give us about a week and a half to do,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess around 10 days. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cdd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, I guess around six o'clock, like, because then I'm already done eating home from work. And I've kind of de stressed already. Six o'clock looks a
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): pretty good time. if you could work without distraction, you would be done by around 730 at the latest with this one page.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, what the one page Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): no distractions. one page. Yeah. All right. let's talk about the the episodes, the TV episodes that you want to watch. Okay? How long are they,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): they're an hour to an hour, okay?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And once a time that you could watch those, you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching, no distractions, I guess,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess around eight o'clock because that's when I'm you know, started getting ready for bed and starting to really relax. And, you know, my husband's home by that time and we can watch it together. He loves the show too.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. eight o'clock, really good time for you to maximize
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): married. And that's a great,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you know, that's a great motivator for you. And I want to try to use it as a motivator. Kind of a reward. Okay, I'd you to try to do is when you start, when you get all these papers assigned when the five, five page papers, pick the five nights that you want to work on it. Okay, it could be Monday through Friday or whatever works for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All right, clearly within the 10 day window, though, all right, five days within the 10 day window, do you have to turn in and then set that time at six o'clock is when you're going to start because that's a good time for you to work.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): let's keep thinking about that when I feel I'm getting off track.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that's sure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. and not have to stress at the end.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And not waste that time in the middle. Yeah. Right. That's, that's really eating more time and your show takes
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I see where you're gonna. Absolutely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does this make sense to you understand kind of,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, you know, that helped me power through and not do things unrelated by you think well, if I get this paper done This page doesn't need to watch my show later.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And I think that's a that's a helpful way to think about it. And that's, that's the cognitive part of this. this is a kind of this is a behavioral strategy because we've talked about these in the past, right? This is behavioral strategy, the cognitive pieces, when you find yourself wandering, I think you have to detect that. And you I think you have some level awareness that's happening. Yeah, you have to detect that and say, I want to watch my show, and we're looking forward to it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And that's your motivation to move through the paper. And then you know, when eight o'clock comes, okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right, that sounds a plan. All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Very good. let's try that for. I'll see again in roughly two weeks.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yep. All right. Thank you. a few weeks.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. Thank you. Thanks.
Summary: The patient wishes to work out motivation to write papers. The paper is five pages long and they start with references. Once they complete the references, they get sidetracked easily. The patient ends up killing two hours of their time and rush to do everything at the last minute. The therapist clarifies the patient is not highly motivated to write. The therapist suggests to break down five page paper into five days and pick the evenings at six o' clock in the 10 day window when they wish to do. The patient could reward themselves if they are successful by watching their favorite TV show in the night which will be a great motivator. The therapist explains this is cognitive part of behavioral strategy and confirms to meet again in roughly two weeks.

Last week when you were you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana. And we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use altogether. And how did you feel about our talk last week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It was okay, I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. Okay, I want to refresh your memory and I've got my notes here. Do you mind if I refer to my notes?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I wasn't in the mood.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm wondering what you could have done in the world.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm not sure what I could have done.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And because of the not exercising, did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it was used a bit more.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay. how would you tie those two things together By not running?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think the mix when I'm not exercising, generally I would turn to the more usage.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah. when you reflect back now on last week, and the rain coming down, and it was cold, I'm wondering if there was a way that you could change your perception about that, such that it wouldn't stop you from running. What do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah To change the perception above, maybe wear a rain jacket or something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mm hmm, that would be a great idea. That would be an excellent idea.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I tried to stay away, but I didn't. I still saw some of them.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life? Last week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you tell me more but what was difficult about it,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the stuff that they think something badly of the I didn't want them to think You know, avoiding the raising.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you did it sounds you didn't want to hurt their feelings.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): by them thinking that you were going to avoid them.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And as a result of this what what happened?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I ended up going to see them and then hanging out.And, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them, you ended up using marijuana. Is that correct?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I could, I suppose I could try hard enough to go and see you guys.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what would that involve trying harder not to go see them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Sometimes it is that simple is making that commitment. yourself and drawing the line. And do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes i do, I don't feel that often, but I could, I could start to see that more.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. How about motivated on a scale of one to 10? Would you say you are to kind of reignite friendships with people that don't smoke pot?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Three.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. you're still, you're still a little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friends again, but I have to ask you, Bruce, what do you what made you say three instead of one?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, because I know for all, I feel I need to, I think I should start doing something about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I think that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards The friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is going to enhance your life incredibly. And when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past, what kind of things did you do?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what what kind of things activities and things?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Was it fun to be with them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, we mostly are doing some outdoor activities, maybe sort of get some pressure kind of thing. Usually it's not like, you know, there's more. They tend to do more healthy activities, I would say.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you can recall living a healthier life then and having fun outdoors and having a healthier life overall, without using the pot.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah You're there. It could be I might take my mind off of it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the pot because it makes you realize that you don't really need it. And I think that's a great, I think that's a great idea.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Was I really had a lot of second thoughts. I was worried about commitment and that kind of thing. I didn't feel that was the the idea.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you had some second thoughts about that. You're excited about it and last week's session, but after you had a chance to reflect upon it, you kind of realized that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best Thanks for you,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I don't have the motivation to be putting in.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think that's wise to recognize that up front, I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet, and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage. I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe. What do you have in mind?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm thinking, do you pets that aren't don't require such a commitment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): That's a good idea. I didn't think about that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Because a dog is the dog is a large commitment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. You know, there's all kinds of animals, snakes or fish or something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Hey, snakes ! fish, that would definitely be a star these animals that you like.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right, I think it's important that you have an animal that you and that you can relate to. Alright, in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana. How did you make out with that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I look into it. But like, I went to the first the first meeting, and I felt like, like, those people were bought on the barrel and I was not I didn't fit in with that crowd where they are not in that place.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you made the effort to go and you went
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I couldn't, I didn't want to stay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you didn't stay the whole time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you left early because you felt you didn't feel and you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can definitely understand I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you. what Do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): See there could be some positive. I don't I don't I don't see it that much at this point.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I would, I would probably be able to relate to people in the same kind of situation. And maybe it's a positive to be able to have connection with people that. I'm not sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you're you're saying that the past of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey, and to have connections with other people. And again, I can send you information that will show you that that these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot, but from increasing the feel good hormones in your body, the connection and the relating to other people. It might be similar when you were younger, you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player. And you had support that was sort of the team was sort of a support group. I'm wondering if you could relate to people in head connections and wondering if you could see a support group as a team.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it would probably be the same kind of situation Essentially, people in a support group are all there for the same goal. it's kind of in hockey. Very important there to win. Mm hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And do you remember when you were playing hockey, how it felt to be encompassed in that team?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it was good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It gave. And that's because of those good feeling hormones that come in neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections. how committed do you think you are? If I were to send you a list of support groups? you could try out some others? Where there weren't the bottom of the barrel? As you say, there? how committed Do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Probably eight, or 10. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Wow. What made you say an eight rather than a four, five was
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a team analogy, I think is a good analogy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you thought How you remembered. You remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And also, you know, I don't have to be the mean, if, if I think of it as a team, maybe I would be the star on the team, because I'm not quite bottom of the barrel. Maybe
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I love that analogy. Good thinking. It's thinking, Bruce. That's excellent. Wow. Well, to summarize, today, you came in, you had made some progress, but you had some stumbling blocks. You have decided that whether it's rain or shine, you're going to run anyway, because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting it Dog, you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, fish. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. And in terms of a support group, I will send you a list of support groups. And you feel that on a scale of one to 10, that you're about an eight, and carrying through and trying out two of these support groups, because of the hockey team analogy. Great job. overall, how would you rate today's session?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It was good, very good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And if we were to put it on a scale of one to 10,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): eight
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): out of eight. All right, we did get in if we did an eight.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): way to go.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. Thanks

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Tommy, I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures from a party you were at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in your life.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mainly drink whenever I'm at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer i'll i'll take sips every now and then. But it's not something that I feel hovers around my life.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's kind of a social thing for you not a major priority. Yeah. How much do you think you're drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess I would say every other every other weekend, maybe every every two weeks. On occasion, maybe There's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer to drink with my boys. But other than that, I don't really see it as much of a of a problem.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I guess you can say that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): When I'm not drinking, I'm usually more like, involved in doing more productive things I I try and do more schoolwork whenever I have the time or whenever I I can go workout or something to like, when whenever I'm drinking, I devote my time to letting loose and having fun and relaxing with friends. Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you you feel you get more stuff done on weekends. When Don't drink, but maybe you don't feel you can relax as well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I, whenever I'm drinking, I know that I'm devoting time to, to not doing other things. I try and make it that I don't allow myself to pile on much work. I try and, get work done before, but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity. I try and minimize that as much as possible.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done. Yeah. Knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder. Yeah. Okay. And it sounds are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit. But because when I'm drinking, I'm, I'm not really focused on what I have to do. I'm focused on the moment and enjoying the time that I have at that time. And it's really something that I it's something of an a pleasure givers and enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What are the things you enjoy about the drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): the way that it, it's sort of liberates you and makes you it makes you feel a more confident, more energetic person that you don't feel yourself you feel a different version of yourself. And it's something that you it, it's empowering to a degree.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways? Yeah? Okay, are there any not good things about drinking.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, whenever I drink too much, I sort of lose control of myself and I I the aftermath of whenever I drank too much or whenever my friends mixed drinks and it has a harmful effect on my body. That's probably one of the major drawbacks that I had from drinking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What kinds of things happen?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mainly when when I puke or it's the the feeling that I get in my stomach, if I drink too much is very overwhelming.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you notice in your body, how much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Wow, I would say probably
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): at a friend, one of my friends had a birthday party recently. And he wanted to let loose was it was the all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it turned into one big party and I I lost it. I drank way too much I would say probably a bottle or two and some beers along the way. I got to a point where I lost count
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that was out of the ordinary For you to discount, what's a more typical amount that you drink?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night. because I know I'm, I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit. But I kind of flirt with my limit to see how far I can go. And I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire, but I want to see how far I can go. I know not to go that far.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Got it. you're you're sort of testing and pushing it in. Yeah. And sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I know how it feels now that later on when this The situation is more drastic and more out of control. I know what I can do and where am I limit is it you?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, kind of along those lines Looking ahead, you know, five years from now, what do you see as a goal for yourself
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in terms of career wise, in terms
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): of what do you think you'll be doing in five years,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and I would love to be.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I would love to travel, I would love to see the world for what it is. And I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is, but I've never really experienced that, like, I've always wanted to travel to Europe or, or China or something or someplace that. I can really experience the world
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that we live in.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): getting a full experience is really important, too. It sounds throughout your life, you know, you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience. And now you're looking at how you can enrich your life in other ways. How do you think drinking too much would fit into, you know, being able to experience life to its fullest?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest. But I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much. Like, often, because I'm I know, I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly, every single day. I don't want to ever get to that point.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. to kind of summarize what you've told me far, you're you're drinking pretty regularly, but you are trying to limit yourself you feel three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences. And you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, feel more in control
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): and then kind of looking ahead. You don't want to Find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives, and it's not appealing to at all. And and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve, that drinking too much could also interfere with. where do you think you want to go from here with with regard to your drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Maybe now that I know, my limits to an extent, I kind of don't want to push it. So, much. Now that I know what I can do and where I can go. I would to mitigate that as much as possible. I want to I want to have fun being me. But I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol. much. I want to live the sober life to an extent, but I know that alcohol is gonna tamper with it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): for now It feels a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're, you're stopping three, for example, or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And not, not drinking, in the mornings or strictly for social purposes not to not have it around, like, I don't want to have it in my fridge, if my parents have it. I don't want to I don't want to have to deal with it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. What do you see as some benefits to that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): benefits and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): sticking to those limits?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess I could definitely be, I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent I could possibly be more productive, more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life. And I think that by not drinking, I will definitely have a better effect on my life.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea. And I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest question. You know, if you don't mind, I would to talk to probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months and kind of check in how things are going. Right. All right. Sounds good.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you very much.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): we're here today to talk about CBT and your experiences of it. How did you feel initially about the thought of going for CBT
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): my clinical psychologist has told me that I needed to see someone. I thought I didn't need to see someone because there was nothing wrong with me. I had a heart disease. And I, my heart disease had got severe and I was tired and there was no one that could make it better. By listening to me or talking to me, the only thing I thought that could heal me was heart surgery. And when he suggested that I see someone, it didn't seem to make sense. But because I was depressed, far gone, I, my husband through my husband, I thought I try and take a chance and listen to someone or let someone Listen to me, because I wasn't sure what it entailed. I've never been to a clinical psychologist before. to me as a clinical psychologist was a shrink, you must have had something seriously wrong with your brain that you needed to see a clinical psychologist, and I didn't need to see one. But when I did Mita and I realized that not being able to make up my mind by Waiting for surgery for heart surgery. I'm putting my name down on the list. I needed someone to help be accepted in order to get surgery done, because I didn't want to get surgery done and she listened to me and to the way I felt and what was making me whoa, hold back on surgery and what made me feel the way I did. And funnily enough, as a woman, you tend to feel that you can cry on someone else's shoulder. But for the first time, letting my emotions out to her. She helped me cry and by me speaking to her, it helped me see myself from the inside. If that makes sense. I then I began to understand why I had to get heart surgery done wasn't because I was tired but I had my family and everyone that went through the road with me of suffering was mad I needed to get it done. And then eventually I did put my name down on the list not knowing it would be done quick because asked was supposed to take me six to eight months to get heart surgery done. But when I started seeing my clinical psychology, I understood it, I put my name down and I got my surgery done in 30 days time. it sounds part of the clinical psychologists role with you is to help you to make your decision around whether to get surgery or not. Yes. But you also said that you were quite depressed at the time was the CBT helpful for your depression as well, it helped because then, instead of crying and holding things back emotionally, it helped me let things out. And by letting things out, it helped me understand what I was feeling because most of the time we bottle things up, we never let them out or we never talk to each other, or other people. when we bottle stuff up, it makes it harder for us to figure out ways to solve problems. Sometimes it can be a little problem and we turn it into a big problem because we don't communicate with other people or talk things over to make it easier to understand. And she helped me understand and I saw her before surgery through my heart surgery and after heart surgery, and she helped me. By then by the time I started with heart surgery, I'd lost myself confidence. I was depressed, I was withdrawn. But after I had heart surgery, and I carried on seeing her, she helped me gain my confidence back again. She helped me gain my trust again, she helped me see that there was something worth loving for again. And a lot of times when I think of the things that are needed for me, it brings tears to my eyes and makes my heart swell up because I didn't know another person could do that for you. By listening to you, you know, when we go to mom when you got a problem and you think no one can understand, but my mom can because she knows what I'm coming from. But it's not to say that clinical psychologists are that. But it's the way they listen to you. having that someone that can listen to you and be there and be still be quiet and let you express yourself. That's how and help you find out what problems are that you've got and help you solve those problems if they can.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Was there anything about the CBT, in particular, that you found was helpful for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Dr. Penny was there with me every step of the way. With all the problems that I had, she helped me Show me that there's an easier way to solve everything and not make a big problem out of everything. There's always someone every step of the way that stayed to help if you need a helping hand. And that's how I in by the time I'd finished therapy with her, I found out that clinical psychologists are not strings. They are people us and they do feel us and it's much easier. To speak to someone when you're having problems because we all do in our lifetime breakdown sooner or later. If you don't have to be mentally ill, you can be in a car accident, any any problems in the home is something you can even have a death in the family that you can break down with. And you need somebody to hear you how you feeling, because we all assume that somebody else naturally knows what I'm feeling or thinking. But it's not that way. We all have different
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): whether any drawbacks to going for CBT
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): in the beginning, I didn't. I didn't have any drawbacks going for CBT because I was severely depressed, I needed it. And I found that they were people all around that would help me there was nothing. The only thing that was stopping me was me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds it was a good experience for us. If you go Any advice that you would want to offer anyone who is thinking now about going for CBT?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yes. Don't look at the word CBT. But look at the person behind it. Because sometimes we see big words and we don't understand the meaning of those words. And we assume, but sometimes when we look behind the word, clinical psychologists, I would have said a shrink and I would never have thought myself going to one because they deal with mental people. But it's not that it's, you can have suffered from depression. You can suffer from any kind of illness and it's good to go to a clinical psychologist when you need them. Because one, sooner or later in our lives, we will need one and most people when you know when you find younger people that nowadays, lots of young people are going under much stress in life. If you haven't got a parent or a friend, and you're suffering from depression, those are the people to speak to because It's good to be able to have someone in your life that you can talk to. Because I know there's no one in my family that I can talk to. I always think my husband would never understand me. My kids would never understand me. When I go to the doctor, he never has that enough time for me. But with a clinical psychologist, they make that time for you. And they listen to you, you've got you've got that time with them to express yourself and you still got follow ups, they can check on you and make sure everything's right. If you not, everything's not alright. They can always check and find ways and means to help you. get you in touch with other people that can help you or get in touch with other people that are in the same. Having the suffering from the same conditions as you and you can swap ideas with each other to find and live a happier life.
Summary: The patient share their experience with CBT. The patient was suffering from a heart disease and believed getting a heart surgery was the only way to heal themselves. The patient was feeling depressed. The patient visited a clinical psychologist and felt better also by letting emotions out to the psychologist which was bottled up all the while. After surgery too, the psychologist helped the patient to regain confidence back. The patient was assisted by Dr. Penny helping them to find easier way to solve things. The patient did not find their family members nor their doctor empathizing with them. On the other hand, clinical psychologists help us express and have follow up sessions. The patient says they also help to get in touch with the right people who had same sufferings as you and can swap ideas to find and live happier life.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, let's see if we could let's rank those two things. one is everyone's judging me how I was and the other is a poor grade. Which one is larger fear for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I would say maybe judging.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, the grades a concern.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah but I figured I could do better on the subsequent one but when people are have this opinion of you I feel that doesn't go away as quickly
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What would it mean? If they they thought you were anxious during that presentation?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I guess I worried that they would think I'm anxious because I don't know what I'm doing or I don't belong there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if they notice your anxiety, then they think you don't belong in that level
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Like, I don't deserve to be in that program.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): If they don't recognize those symptoms, they wouldn't think that, do they?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): they might write that maybe they think that's why I'm anxious or that's why I'm not doing well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the programming room?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): I think you know, typically, I'm one of the top students in my program, and I've seen two Get the concepts pretty well. It's when I have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via, a presentation or something, that I'm worried that, you know, maybe I'm an imposter or something, but I start to question myself. But I think in general that, you know, I'm a pretty good student before this. And I'm doing pretty in the program.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you're a good student, you recognize that you have this one area where you don't feel you do a great job. That's presentations. In terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation. But grades aside, you're anxious. And you're worried your classmates are gonna pick up on them.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. if they thought you were us were imposter. if they thought you were imposter to say that that was something they believe because of what's been happening. What would that mean? What would it mean to your classmates that you were an imposter?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): I don't know. Maybe I am. Maybe I don't deserve to be there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You don't deserve to be there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): maybe I shouldn't be in this program. I think they should drop out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical symptoms, anxiety and mood that means to you anyway, that that means you shouldn't be on there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What's it feel to say that
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Depressing I feel I've worked really hard. You know, to get through atleast halfway through my program. And it really hurts to think that that will be true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): think this whole time you really been given faking Do you really belong there?. I'd to move a little bit into evaluating evidence. in this kind of therapy, we to look at what, you know, what we're feeling and what we're thinking, and what's we can see what's observable around us. And, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it, okay. You're worried at some level. You're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are now. Yeah. That you're not good enough. To be a student in this program, yeah, programming. What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Now that I'm thinking about it here, I mean, there's not a ton to support. But in on that day, I can think of all sorts of, you know, things to tell myself
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): what's going on that day.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): maybe I'm not prepared or because I'm messing up on the presentation that I'm going to get a bad grade and you know, if I can't speak in front of people, how am I going to speak in front of kids as a teacher, you know, one day that it will translate to something else. I can't get past this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): even if you survived the program, somehow you might be bad at your job
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): any other evidence that points toward you being imposter?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=1): Besides My bad grade? Not a whole lot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right. to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I'm not good enough is kind of based on your feelings of anxiety.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Which are really intense panic almost in the moment.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah in a way you're believing With the anxiety will lead you to believe.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, definitely.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But in the bright light of scrutiny, there are a lot of facts to support the worst case, which is you don't deserve it. How about evidence that refutes that you're not good enough?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program. there's kind of like, a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff, which I passed, to get interviews and such to get into the program. I did that. I said, I'm a pretty good student, all considering, you know, before this kind of flick was happening.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you've got through a rigorous process to become a student You're doing well. You mentioned before, the one bad grade right? Okay, if you have friends in this program, right, if one of them came to you with this, this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety, yeah, versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well, otherwise, what advice would you give them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): I mean, now that you're kind of talking about it, like, you know, this or that sort of thing. It makes sense. I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty far. You know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you're doing your performance, rather than that one grade
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I think I tried to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of really, you were saying, your anxiety tells you sort of I think I can think that but I think my anxiety symptoms are such in the moment that it's really hard. You know, and I'm replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): So, let's look at the the thought and the feeling. If you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, now now, yeah, but here with me. How much of your mind believes that that's true?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): I would say like, you know, a two or three not very, I don't believe it very much now because You know, I'm not presenting and it's you and I not a group full of people. that pressure is not there here.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that is correct
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): now let's move to let's say in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there, and the classmates that could be looking at you, it could be negatively evaluating you because you're worried about how much do you believe that thought then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't feel really confident. In that moment. It feels very real. Like, any moment, they're gonna kick me out. Like, I'm not doing well. I'm stuffing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. really intense. would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or not. Now, or when you're in that state of anxiety,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): definitely now that anxiety that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this evaluation, the percent that you believe that true, this evaluation is more accurate?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, I think so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood now, or you can evaluate accurately?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would say, you know, when I'm not at risk of presenting, like, I feel I spend the majority of my time, like, it's not something I worry about all the time, leading up to and then mostly that day,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): okay. the, you're able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right? There's a limited amount of time when you're not when there's A lot of motions going through, right? And at those times, you're maybe a little less reliable,
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): right. my judgment is clouded.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): However, in that moment you still, those thoughts are strong, right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, very troubling.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense. And you kind of carry that around a little bit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I can see why this is frustrating for you.
Summary: The patient has a larger fear over everyone judging them. The patient believes other classmates recognise their symptoms of anxiety and may feel the patient does not deserve the program. The patient has had only one bad presentation in terms of grades. But on the day of presentation they think of reasons to mess up and are scared how they are going to speak in front of kids as a teacher in the future. The patient agrees a lot of their anxiety comes from their thought and not evidence. The patient agrees if they were to advice someone else in similar situation, they would assure the other person doing well and only the cumulative grades will be considered. The patient has an anxiety in anticipation that something will happen. The patient agrees their evaluation is clear at other days when they don't have presentation, however they point out that the emotions are intense during the presentation and their judgement is clouded.

<PrimaryTopic: behavior> <SecondaryTopic: interaction> <GlobalEmotion: 0.00>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, Charles, let's take a look at your homework from last week the activity schedule.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Not very much on it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'll take a look at it and see, well, you did complete most of it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't see the point. And I mean, how do you master watching TV or eating a meal? I, if I had tried to use chopsticks, I suppose it would have some mastery involved in but I, I didn't mess with chopsticks, okay. Food was okay. Hmm. But not, not great. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it was tough. And I want to be clear, though, Charles that this is very typical though for many people that we work with. It's very difficult to complete homework worksheets, because things happen, right? I don't feel that Well, sometimes things get in the way. There's things that prevent me from doing that. I think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult. what would you say what would be some barriers that made it difficult to Your mastery ratings.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't enjoy anything. And I used to I used to enjoy it a lot of things. But I don't even I don't look forward to breakfast, particularly cup of coffee. The news is mostly bad and what if there is news? I mean, the paper doesn't carry much national news anymore. So, I mean, I have to eat, but I really don't see the point of a lot of things.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay. Well, I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things. versus the cons. there's a worksheet that I have called a decisional balance worksheet. And it takes two separate decisions. One decision is to engage in activities, and there's some benefit to doing that. And then another decision would be to not engage in activities. There's benefit to that. But there's also cost to both of those decisions. I think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there's more benefit or cost to completing that? What do you think about that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, that would depend on the activity. I know but okay. I could, I could get in touch with somebody I could call a friend. Maybe try to meet somebody for lunch.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's a great idea. what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I would, I would enjoy the company. Okay, and wouldn't be as lonely I suppose.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that sounds great. sounds one benefit would be you'd enjoy the company. Yeah. And you wouldn't be as lonely. I'd write that down. Okay, good.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Company company and said not as lonely not only. That's good, okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, can you think of the downside to potentially doing that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, one downside might be that he wouldn't be interested in having lunch with me. I haven't been a whole lot of fun lately. And, or he might be busy and might not not might not be able to have lunch.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, or
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): he might want to talk about what's going on in my life and I'm ready We don't want to talk about that let somebody talk about it with you course. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it sounds the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy.
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right? That could be the downside. Is that right? Okay. might not be able to come. Sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. I'd write that is a great job Charles with the top two boxes with the first decision. let's move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same and there's some benefit to that and there's some cost to that as well. Sure. Okay, Charles, we completed the worksheet. what's your overall impression about the benefits of changing versus the cons and staying the same?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, it makes sure that the, the benefits outweigh the cons. If, if I make the change if I don't make the change I'll be doing what I've been doing and I'll be getting up wondering, what's the point? And still be lonely. And
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Those are good observations, Charles. So, which activity doesn't make the most sense to try for homework this week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I call somebody I think, Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's a good observation. So, let's say for homework, then you tried to call someone to get together with a friend. And how about also trying to complete a full day of the activity schedule, and completing both the mastery and the pleasure ratings? What do you think about that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sure. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And if it gets Difficult, which again, that's pretty normal for that to take place. If it gets hard, we can talk about it next time and we can problem solve together and figure out how to remove those barriers. Does that sound good?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sure. Okay, okay.
Summary: The therapist discusses patient's last week homework schedule. The patient is disinterested to carry out the activities. The therapist explains that it is a decisional balance worksheet and request to weigh pros and cons for each activity. The patient feels calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch sounds exciting and wouldn't be as lonely. The therapist highlights the practical downsides to that maybe the person is busy and not able to come from the responses from patient. The patient agrees the cons of staying the same will not change anything and they will feel lonely. The therapist encourages to meet someone as a homework and asks to try out a full day activity schedule. The therapist aknowledges it will be hard and the problems can be addressed in next session.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): daily?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah, because I mean, if I go grocery shopping or if I go clothes shopping or for any kind of money transactional thing, you know, which I would encounter daily pretty much it happens
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I would fill up your car gasoline.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): then bipac accom.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): it has an effect that level two.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you're thinking it almost the number of transactions has to be more than one. I mean, it has to be two or zero.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. No. Or vitamins or number of transactions? Yeah. Because see if I get gas, then I have the gas in my car. That's the thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): That's one transaction and one thing and one thing, okay. And then. Okay, that's one product, right? And you need another product. Right? you really can't feel your car without going inside the station. Store.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): NO
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it doesn't matter that there's more than one gallon going in, is because it's the same product.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Exactly. Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I could see now this, this would be more of a daily thing. You said, Right. Yeah. Because at first I was thinking daily. That's a lot of individual shopping trips, but it applies to all transaction.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Exactly. Yeah. I did really realize that that way. But it does. Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): this is a fairly significant source of anxiety for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, it is. It does. Pr I get, you know, like, builds up in me and I feel it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): let's talk about that. And help me to understand this better. let's say that you went to a convenience store, and had one thing in mind, what might be a potential item that you would gum? gum, right? you want to go in and you want to buy a pack of gum. That's all you really want. That's why you stopped at the store.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you go in, you have any thoughts? Now we talked in the past about automatic thoughts, these thoughts kind of come in, right. are there any thoughts in there happening when you're walking into the store?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I start. I start with what do I need? Why am I here? You know, I need a pack of gum. And then it's instant anxiety that what else am I gonna get? What else can I get to make it the two?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All right. the thought is What else can I get? Yeah, this one, the past will be two has to be two. It has to be two. That's not that's Yeah. that's also possible more demanding. Yeah. it has to be.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I guess the first thought is what else? What else do I have to get? Yeah. And then jumps
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): to the anxiety. is the anxiety
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It starts going down. Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it's really gradually
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yes, but it is really it is really Yes. Once it completely gone. When I'm done that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright, you really the the worst anxiety would be approaching the store entering in that moment of uncertainty. When you don't know the second Yeah,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): absolutely. All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. if you could relieve that anxiety, that would be one of your goals.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That would be fantastic. Fantastic.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. let's think about this way. Do you? Do you know the reason that you do this? You have any guesses?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I would guess that. I mean, we've talked about you my dad had some bad experiences I had I sound awful. Yeah, they've, they were difficult. I wonder if that's not somehow linked to this behavior somehow. Being impossibly
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright. you've been through some really tough times to put it mildly. And what You're afraid of if you only buy the one item? Is something safety related happening?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes. Yes. the car accident or the Yes. Safety. Definitely my personal safety or my family's safety.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And I guess security the
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): security Yeah. And yeah, security.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): safety and security. They're at risk for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): When you don't follow this role, the rule and I will Yeah. if we think about it in terms of the cognitive model, we talked about the core beliefs and the intermediate beliefs, which are the attitudes and assumptions expectations, the core belief here the only thoughts when it might be
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): well, now that you said that, or you know, pointed out those safety security issues, I didn't really realize that but it is. Maybe that that I'm not okay, I'm not
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm not okay. I'm not safe. I am vulnerable,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): vulnerable. Yeah, I'm vulnerable. Am I an exposed? exposed to danger to?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Sure at risk? Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's my rule.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And then when a situation presents itself, which would be an impending transaction. That's the situation we talked about how the situation blends together. With that, in this case rule that intermediate. when they come together, what's that automatic thought?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): When the situation and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): trends potential transactions approaching you, and you handed me a belief I need to buy everything
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): in tears. What else am I getting in?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And then what's the behavior? That is a product of that automatic thought of I do you buy the second item? Yeah. And the feeling is the feeling of falls.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that follows that purchase of
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): well, the follows on Mac thought, oh, anxiety, anxiety, and then what's the feeling that follows the purchase? Yeah. Relief relief. Alright. can you see how the mechanism what's happening to you could be explained one explanation through through the cognitive load
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): there much it didn't sit very well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Alright. let's talk about the rule of the Rule of Two. Now we, we, we talked before, we're talking about cognitive therapy, about useful and less than useful thoughts, right? functional and less functional or dysfunctional. thoughts. Do you think that sitting here now, not much necessarily in the store? I know that's probably a different thought process. But talking with me now, do you see a causal connection between purchasing two items and a safety or security breach?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. I mean, there's no I recognize you recognize your Work and stuff that it's not. It doesn't make sense. It's not a useful, a useful thought maybe
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): it's not a useful in this case thought munei useful intermediate belief.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you recognize that you appreciate that. There is not a link between Elio purchasing here. And in either direction, though, meaning, you realize that, that if you buy to, this doesn't necessarily keep you safe either. you can't introduce safety or the process of risk of being unsafe, you can't introduce risk or safety through your transacting behavior.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's very true. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it does. It really does. I Can't it doesn't make what you're saying makes sense. But it doesn't make sense to introduce safety or either side of the point.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do overs or rest are not influenced by your behavior.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But that's not what your mind is telling you. That's not what your thoughts are telling you. That's logical. And you can sit here with me. And it's not easy to say, but you can say, Yeah, I don't see a link.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I don't see a link, but I know what I feel and what I feel is that impending doom, if you will.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): let's talk about that moment. in this moment, maybe a little anxious now, but you can kind of see how, you can't protect yourself or cause harm to yourself or anyone else. By buying to or failing to buy to write in the store, or wherever you make the transaction, different story. you have, let's, let's go a different direction. I talked about how you walk into a store, and you think, well, I get those the phone, right? And you end up getting something else. Yes, the anxiety then kind of goes away. And we'll come up the next time that happens. But it's a way it's gone for that moment. So, I want you to kind of stay with me as I go through another scenario. And you maybe have figured out what I'm going to do here, but
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I need it in your scenario. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): maybe GM isn't the ideal example but you see my yeah. See, you go into the now you go to the store, you realize you only have enough resources to make the one transaction and you really want it zero is not. So, now walk me through the thoughts and the feelings
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what I would normally do or what I
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): would think would happen
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would panic. I mean not panic, break down or something, but I mean it would be very, very stressful if I absolutely had to get that item. Um, I would probably try to scrape change out of my car, but I know we're not going there now. Yeah, no stay there. But um, I would be very, very difficult.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Could you do it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm physically capable of doing it. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that is one level of being able. But how about in terms of your thinking? And your feeling?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I could do it, I could do it. I could get through it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what would happen? How much anxiety with you experience and with the anxiety fade off?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It will fade off? I think. I mean, it would have to, I would imagine, it would fade. I think it would take a longer period of time to fade than if I had gotten even now seeing here, but even if I had gotten another item, okay, the world is going to be safe for another five minutes. We're good. How much you're feeling now? very anxious, right? Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Are you worried is the kind of anxiety where you're worried that something catastrophic is gonna happen? Okay, even talking about a transaction of one can lead to anxiety connected to this safety and security.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you can you can trigger that without a transaction even pending.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): really scared sitting here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): is unbearable the anxiety of men's embarrassment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes, it's bearable, it's bearable,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but does it hurt stuff?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it's hurt me feel bad.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What do you feel is gonna happen with seeing xiety about
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): your scenario of having to having to get only one item or having only having the resources for one item and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it's not a safety and security. It's a it's a concern about going through and buying one item on the rule. Those two Yeah, yeah. And I'm talking about breaking the rule.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know it's terrifying. This this this skin for you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Because you're anxious about that. And you're also anxious about the consequences of that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the anxiety you're experiencing now in this moment with me, I want you to be mindful that, guys keep that in your awareness and let me know if that changes. interrupt me if you need to. It's not.
Patient [DialogueFunction=com] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it might get worse. It might get better. So, is there something on your mind that you need to buy within the next couple of days?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. coffee, coffee.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's a transaction of one.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, I'll get something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, right. Yeah. understandable, but what if, what if I challenged you to behavioral Experiment. Okay, can you guess what that might be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): To buy one coffee? In scenario two,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to buy one to buy one cup of coffee? And then I don't know where to buy the coffee, but leave? Yeah, wherever it is leave. what are the possible things that could happen? Knowing that logically you can connect it to a safety thing, and you might be anxious about that. And that's real, that anxiety is real. But knowing that the event isn't prevented or caused by exactly the transacting behavior. Let's go through what happens. you buy the coffee. You're really anxious. Right? up to it, you're anxious to go into driving there either.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would have a lot more anxiety. But I would really have to talk myself through that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Would it go away?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I believe it was the anxiety, I believe.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it'd be more painful experience to buy the one.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But it wouldn't harm you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=com] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Oh, yeah. No, not at all.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But it would cause you more internal anxiety.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what would happen if you did again,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would hope that it would be less anxiety. Could be, could be
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): repeated 100 times.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It could be I would get old. I think the anxiety would get exhausted.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): really, what you're doing is you're conditioning you'd be conditioning yourself to, to to surviving buying the one item. I have a lot more money financial advantages to it certainly. And there'd be a you know what I hope is a freedom advantage which is the freedom to buy any number of miners, the next what what scenario of purchasing i know i i asked for the coffee example I mean I asked one thing you're going to buy the coffee, but what what scenario could you see yourself being most likely to fall through this? I don't know if the coffee is the optimal situation for that behavior experiment maybe I guess it would there be another item that would be easier to fall through for example, the gasoline because you'd get your car by the gasoline and you leave. Yeah, that would be easier for you. You will be tempted by the other I
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): wouldn't have to walk through the coal to the store, or to the, the door of the
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): wood. That'd be easy. It'd be, you know, might be
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That would be much easier. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): we will, we will consider that kind of a step in a direction that would result in fewer symptoms. Yeah, that would be wonderful. And maybe another step in the future if we get there. it goes with us, but it would be to go into the store and buy one but let's not let's not do that. Okay. Let's stick with the gasoline.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. I feel more confident about that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You feel you could succeed with that. Yeah, experiment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): We'll see when we get there, but yes, I would to. I feel I could try that. More than the coffee.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): are you afraid with the coffee that you might end up buying too? Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how's your anxiety now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I feel better than I don't have to buy one cup of coffee.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that was a stressor.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But I feel it's it's miles. But but okay. But it was.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But mostly because the experiment that we're talking about somewhat easier
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And because I think the insight that you gave me on, I hadn't connected the safety security, I hadn't connected all the dots. that was very helpful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): one of the we talked about before, what do I mag thoughts adaptive responses, right. as you're trying to kind of push through this experience of feeling car, you're going to have those thoughts still come up. And the adaptive response could be something like, Well, I'd you to design it or work with me and design it. But could be something like, I know this will have a consequence in the real world. Yeah, I realized this is how responding internally doesn't take away the anxiety, necessarily. It might, but it will help you maybe get through that process. Yeah. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. There's a few things I'm asking you to do. Right. One is to buy gasoline needed and only by gasoline. And at the same time when those thoughts come up to respond to them with the adaptive responses to compare the two.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, gotcha.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ci] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Apparently got it. Right. I know this won't have real consequence. In reality, that could be one. And if you have any others, you know, you can apply to as as apply them. I know that I can tolerate the anxiety. Yeah, seems you've tolerated for a long time. It's not pleasant. It's not what you want. But you can tolerate.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And maybe another adapter response would be, this is painful for me. But if I can be successful here, if I can get rid of things,
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah. The longer term picture Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And keeping your island moving up to coffee and other other behavioral goals. that. Yeah, that makes sense.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I that a lot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): we're kind of attacking anxiety from a lot of different angles here. Okay?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do you do believe that you can succeed with this idea?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I do. It's been a long time. But I that I mean, the behaviors and the thought processes have been in place for a long time. I think it'll be a challenge but i think you know, it's time
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. well, that can be very Positive that you know what I detected there was, you're ready to challenge the six idea. Right? Like, I would to take the devil's courage. Yeah, yeah. you're ready to say I've had enough. And you can see a clear path of behavior that can help you get through it and you're ready to take the anxiety on. That can be a positive adaptive response, right? being assertive and saying, almost you're talking to the anxiety in a way okay, right, but I'm not gonna let you beat me this time. That's what you'd be saying to the anxiety.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I that one. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): So, make a note of all these right? And you can use the same one more than once. You can mix them up, whatever works for you. Okay, but keep applying them as needed through the whole process into your home, your is your no more risk to go by. It's great. Yeah. Cuz it because I think once you get home really, that's, that's the completion of only participating that one transaction right, you've left and go back to restarting the cycle. right. you've, you've permanently recorded buying the one thing. Yeah, that's a victory. Yeah. That'd be a huge victory. I don't know if you know the status of your gas tank now. Do you foresee needing to get gas between now and next week?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Oh, yeah, you do? need to do that. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=hp] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): if you could try that out. And if you could record kind of in the moment, after it's over the experience in terms of your feelings, different stages, that would be helpful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Thanks.
Summary: The patient is anxious about the shopping habit that they have. The patient feels to buy everything in pairs of two. The patient has the urge to look for another things around the store if they have only one thing to buy. They are okay to not buy anything at all too. The patient clarifies it applies to any money transactions which has to be two or zero. The patient experiences worse anxiety when they enter a shop without knowing the second item. The patient believes that this behavior is linked to their personal and family's safety. They feel vulnerable. The patient feels relieved when they buy two items. The patient can have bearable anxiety triggered just be talking about one transactions. The therapist suggests to buy one coffee, and once it is done a 100 times, the patient's anxiety would get exhausted. The patient agrees to try and affirms they didn't feel to link this to safety and security. This can reduce their symptoms. The therapist gives another suggestion to buy gasoline alone and get back home. If they successfully get back home, that a mark of completion and victory to the patient. The therapist asks to respond them with adaptive response for the two, and make note of their experience.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Do you have on your presentation? Do you have many? bullet points you want to cover? Like,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, okay, an outline sort of thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): We never thought about that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation. Maybe you'd have 10 or 20. Yeah, depending on how long maybe you as you start to review a certain bullet point As you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply. And then as you continue on, you let out that breath really slowly,
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a rhythm sort of, huh? Yeah. Can you go and do the same thing?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I thought about it that way. I'm thinking it'd be some way to structure. you would, you would get in many breaths,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): something I wouldn't forget. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit. Okay. make sure you keep your bullet points of length. About a few paragraphs. Yeah. But a few seconds each. you can get a good deep breath and, or you could, you know, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously, several breaths, but some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete. Yeah. Because I know that. In that moment, things are probably you mentioned zoning out and It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, exactly. And get really foggy, almost dizzy.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths. And that might be something you can really have one too. Yeah. And would we kind of cut through that fogginess something could still do. Okay. When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): The next one, I believe is next Friday.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that the next presentation you have? in all the classes is the one
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. .
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. And that's next Friday. Mm hmm. Do you know where you are in the order? for presenting?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Um, I think I'm third in this one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): not first. And this one's how many minutes
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm 15 or so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, it's a little shorter than 20 minutes. you have about a half hour, maybe a little more, if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there, right. And potential time where you could be anxious. Yes, but also potential time and you could be reviewing the notes your bullet points and breathing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And saying to yourself, that's like, kind of self talk, that they're not really paying attention to me anyway. Right. Right. Because that might help reduce that. That anxiety. Yeah. What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I guess I could say that, you know, in general, I do pretty well. You know, one bad grade as in going to war. Make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, the sort of self talk up there could be I deserve to be here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe I've prepared enough, you know that I know that I've prepared. And I'm a good student. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I've prepared enough. I'm a good student. I deserve to be here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that something that would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think it would actually, I can recite that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, internally as you because it's not long.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think I could, it will be easy to remember. And I could maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And how much do you believe that those statements are true?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think you know, sitting now, sitting here now I believe them in the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convinced myself otherwise. But I think I believe that that that that's true. They deserve to be in the program.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, there's those self talk items. You believe them to be true. Yeah, but you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this. You might not believe them as much, right? But remember that, you know, we worked on them. Right? You came up with them.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you believe them now. Right? try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. It's easy. I realize it's easy to form these plans. Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Then the chaos of anxiety in the words is harder. the more tasks you can make concrete, and you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be. Okay. I would to see you your presentations next Friday. Yeah, I would to see you before that. be about a week. for that. Do you have any questions? These are items you can rehearse still even without the presentation, the self talk and write the breathing, and of course preparing. But you have any questions between now and then you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I don't think I think it makes sense. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Understand kind of the plan to attack that anxiety symptom
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=1): And I think you know, what you kind of suggested before, like, maybe practicing my deep breathing. maybe now, when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like, I'm more apt to also remember it, then.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. So, good. you have some kind of behavioral pieces. Focus on studying the breathing. And cognitive pieces that the self talk we talked about, yeah. That you use when you're seated and use when you're at the podium,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And presenting. Alright, good. I'm glad we have a plan going forward. I think that you did a really good job today, helping kind of untangle this and figure out what's going on. And I appreciate that. You were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they're related. Yeah. And I feel this is something that's going to serve you as you move through this.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. I'll see you in, in a week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Thanks.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks, Hazel.
Summary: The therapist is helping the patient with a presentation by using bullet points to cover. The therapist requests the patient to take deep breaths, in some structure while reviewing the bullet points. The patient is trying to avoid zoning out or dizziness. The therapist suggests three deep breaths per bullet point. The patient has a presentation next Friday and they have half an hour before their turn to present. The patient plans to practice breathing during that time, give themselves a self talk that they are a good student and one bad grade doesn't mean they don't deserve to be there. The patient is asked to make a card to recite these. The therapist also acknowledges that these may not be easy in the actual situation and asks the patient to practice this continously since this can be practiced without the presentation. The therapist asks to rehearse and meet them before the presentation, in a week. The therapist asserts to the patient that they are attacking the anxiety symptom.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sam is healthy other than some seasonal allergies and everything else Okay, then.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Actually, not quite. I don't know what's been happening but between last school year and this year, all of a sudden I'm getting these phone calls from his teacher saying that he's not paying attention in class. They think he has ADHD all of a sudden. I mean, I don't know where this is coming from. But this is not the same kid I had a year ago.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, sounds there's a little bit more going on that and some more worries that you wanted to talk about. perhaps it makes sense that, that we take a few minutes and then I chat with you, and then I'll spend a few minutes with Sam. Sure. It'll be great. Okay, Sam, do you want to go in, hang out in the waiting room for bed and I'll come find you in a few minutes. Go ahead, honey. tell me about Sam and the issues that he's having in school.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, he's a totally different kid and not in a good way. All of a sudden, this year, I've been getting calls three, four times a week from his teacher, the principal. They're saying things he's acting out in class. He's having little kind of angry spurts. All of a sudden, he's not doing his homework, which is completely new to me. His grades are slipping. I mean, he used to be like, 70s 80s 90s kids. Now he's getting 60s. this feels
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a real diversion from last year real change from last year. Oh, totally night and day. Okay, it sounds there's been some problems at home. I'm going to ask you some screening questions that I asked all the parents, some of them might fit for you. And some of them may not probably take about five minutes, and we'll go through them together. Sure, let's do it. why don't we start with how you're doing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Um, honestly, I'm getting by. I mean, I think you know, Darrell and I got divorced last year. He's somewhere out in BC God only knows where.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): is he seeing Sam at all, or?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think they Skype maybe once every couple months, but he's really not been in contact. And he's not been sending the money that he promised he would. we're not thrilled with him now.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): has that meant that finances have been tight or?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I mean, I was kind of counting on the child support to come in. You know, things are tight with three people household and then For almost since long, Darren's been gone. My mother has also moved in with me. She, you know, as you get older, she's starting to get a little bit more dementia. Some people stick their parents in a home but I was the good daughter and I decided to take her into mind.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): lots of changes, lots of things going on. Yeah. And how do you feel you're managing with all that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I mean, some days are obviously better or worse than others it's been a lot of changes you said, I mean, I'm not getting enough sleep I'm things are tight financially.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Emotionally, how have you been doing them and managing things are
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you know sometimes very stressful, if my mother has an episode or when I get called from school, but like, I don't think I'm really depressed or anything, it it's kind of day to day thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there are ever any times that you're not managing well, you're not good at able to get out of bed or do the things that you need to do in a day.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): There's a couple mornings that I sleep in, but it's really I still kind of get by I get everything done I need to like, I know it's kind of a tough time now but I don't feel it's gonna be hopeless forever. Hopefully.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): some struggles but yeah, okay. Do you ever cope with using drugs or alcohol?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I mean my mother used to drink but I tried to be really aware of not using that as a crutch.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): then no drinking at all at home?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): no drinking and I definitely don't want drugs in the house for the kids. none of either.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What about making sure that Sam and your little one have what they need in terms of winter coats or food or or those sorts of things?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I I'm doing the best I can you know, like, we haven't gotten a chance to get winter coat shopping yet. His from last year still kind of it It's not great but it's solution for now.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): he's wearing his coat from last year. Yeah. Do you have a sense about is that hard because of finances are there other reasons
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): mostly finances but I mean kind of time too to get everybody out the door to go grocery shopping or go clothes shopping. It's a big ordeal. Right? I mean, I know. We didn't pick up everything he wanted her back to school this year either. It would be easier to add a few extra dollars in a few extra hours.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Sam's not always having the things that he needs now then.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess not exactly. No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. And what about you know food or you deserve food in the fridge? Are you able to put food on the course
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, we have the bulk foods were membership. when we do get out I let Sam pick out things he likes to make, you know, macaroni stuff for sandwiches, cereals. That way, you know sometimes he makes himself breakfast in the morn. before school or dinners,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what kinds of things does Sam have for dinner?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I said, he'll do macaroni. You know, sometimes it's not great, but I'll do the fruit or, you know, sometimes some snack food, sometimes more comprehensive meals, I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I was what would you say he does? Is he cooking? Or are you cooking or both?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess kind of a mix of both. To be honest, like,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): with all the stress in the house, has there been any times that people have kind of gotten really upset with Sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful things to him?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Not really. I mean,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And what about how his discipline handled in your house? Has anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt Sam in any way?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, never. I mean, I used to give him timeouts when he was younger, but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What about sexual abuse? Has anyone touched Sam in a sexual way or an inappropriate way? Excuse me? Yeah, that's a hard question to hear for lots of people. But I asked everybody that question,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): no, no, never. I I would never let that happen to my child. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, he's been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch. Okay. how do you think Sam's doing in his close family relationships do you think Sam's feeling loved And supported.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I know I guess I haven't really been around for him as much as I'd to be obviously, I do the best to let them know we know how much I care for him. Sometimes we have a little bit more money, I can get him something nice that he wants. You know, I've heard him kind of, he's kind of a thought that Oh, you love the baby more than you love me. But that's that's obviously not true. I love both my kids.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what do you think he would say if he was here? And I asked him if he felt loved.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'd hope he'd say yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's some doubt?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, I said, I'm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You mentioned that there was some some some difficulties with your mom.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): Well, she's lived with us for the past year or so. She was diagnosed with dementia she has days where she remembers Everything and days where she started to slip more and more. And she she's very judgmental very opinionated. She has the way she likes things. And
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): has there been any time that your mom has become physically aggressive in the home?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, never.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And what about her relationship with you? How is she managing or how are you managing together with her in the home?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Some days are definitely better than others. She like, I guess you could say I kind of tried to check her behavior when she was getting a little bit
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And Has it ever come to physical blows between the two of you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, no arguments here and there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And when you mean arguments how intense are those arguments getting?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): we raise our voices I mean, it's I'm doing the best I can here
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is it ever it's never come to physical blows?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, never. I'd have to take some other action if that happened.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that, that that intensity, is that kind of arguing or is it yelling, screaming and door slamming or people throwing objects?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I guess you could say we've gotten pretty loud. I mean, she'll go and kind of slam things in her room. You know, I'm, I obviously I wouldn't ever let her hurt the kids.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And where are Sam and the baby when these things are happening?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Sam will usually go and hide in this room, maybe turn this music up. You know, Lee's sometimes napping in the crib in the playpen, I guess to be totally honest, I do lose my patience and scream more than I'd to but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it sounds there's kind of a lot of tension and, and, and arguing in that relationship. How often would you say that that's happening that it comes to that kind of arguing and yelling place?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I guess a few times a week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can one sort of last question what has anyone in your family been in prison or in jail?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, never.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. thank you very much for sharing all of that. I'm going to recap. Sounds there's been a lot of stressors and lots of change over the last year. Yeah. Sam status moved away, which is kind of created some changes in finances, which have led to, maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you've needed or that Sam has needed. You've got, your mom has moved in, and there's some stress and tension and arguing that's happening in that. And you've also told me that maybe all of these stressors and stuff have contributed to Sam not feeling as loved or as cared for. On the other hand, it sounds you're managing emotionally and that you're not using any drugs or alcohol. You have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical, emotional or sexual abuse. For Sam and his life, and that nobody in your family more in Sam's life has gone to prison. I think you're there is likely a connection between kind of what's happening for Sam in school and the difficulties that he's starting to have with all of these stresses and changes at home. I'm going to book a follow up appointment for you and Sam to come in. And at that time, we'll talk about some of the ways in which I might be able to help or develop a plan together.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sounds Sounds good. Thank you. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in as soon as you can. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And you said you wanted to see Sam for a bit as well.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. You gotta see Sam now. And then when when I'm done, make sure on the way that you talk to reception about making another appointment. Okay. All right. Exactly. Last All right. Okay. Thanks.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah, I live in a house with multiple cars. I tried driving my mom's car one day and you know, I have the same feelings. And initially I thought it was my car because I did notice some damage to the back of the car. I was in the bag and I was going through the trunk one day and I saw that the the core was pushed in. I didn't think there was any real damage and I noticed damage to the back of the car. And I was like, wow, you know, I have been seriously hurt in this accident. And that's when I started having these feelings I started thinking about how bad the accident could have been. So, you asked if I tried to do anything different. I tried driving my mom's car. I tried driving my dad's car, but it seems to be driving any car, having all this anxiety.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hello, Peggy, how you doing today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you're okay. Glad to hear that. Yesterday, when you're here at the agency, you took a few different tests. Remember that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I did.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): One of the tests you took is called the SCL 90, the symptom checklist 90. Do you remember taking that test?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It's 90 items. And they are ranked
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): asked me true and false questions?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Not true and false are numbers that you solve.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Oh, okay. I do remember that. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I have the results from that test. I want to review some of those findings with you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): this particular instrument has a number of what we refer to as sub scales. these are areas that are measured by the instrument, right? For example, depression or anxiety. I'm going to review a few of these sub scales, ones where you scored a little higher than we might expect. And review those with you and see. See what you're thinking we can talk about.
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, are you recording this?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Are very worried about that?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is it what makes you think I'm recording?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Because that happens to me a lot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It happens to you a lot that you get recorded.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Remember the last time it happened?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You probably yesterday
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you think you were recorded while you're taking this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): probably. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That sounds worrisome. That's that's a feeling you get a lot that you're being recorded.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I worry about it a lot.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You worry about it a lot.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): But you know, it's happening. That's why I worry about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're certain that's happening?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Where you're not being recorded now. I know. It probably feels you are, but you're not. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. But I appreciate you bringing up that concern with me. I think in school,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): in school, right? I that would make sense. So, say for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65% percentile, that would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of people that took that test. Okay, that makes sense. if you took a test on math or English, and you would say 75 percentile, you'd be higher than three quarters of people took the test. 75% Okay, understand? Does that make sense? I think so. Okay. If you want me to come back to that later, let me know as I go through if it doesn't make sense, okay. areas here on on the SCL results, or you were a bit higher than we would normally see. A one is the phobic anxiety scale. on that one, you were about 64 percentile. your score was as high or higher. Than 64% of people who take it
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to more than half the people in the population,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): more than half the number and half the people in the same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I have more phobic anxiety than most people.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It does seem that way. Yeah. this construct would measure things being afraid of going out being afraid of being a crowds. Does that connect with you? Is that seem a fear that you have?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Tell me about that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): I don't being on public transportation. Hmm. And crowds make me nervous. If I ever have to public speak, I feel I'm going to pass out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it does appear you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms. that that score today that 64 percentile. That kind of makes sense.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I kind of get that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I want to move on to the next one, which is paranoia. On this one, you were at the 84th. percentile. quite a bit higher.
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is that why you were recording me?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But this, this wasn't recorded, nothing was recorded here. Understand that's a worry that you have.
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Are you going to share those results with anybody?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in your particular case, the only people will be shared with this the rest of the treatment team and anybody that you sign a release for,
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but if the government asks you, you'd have to give them those results.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's no reason now I did that there are certain limits to confidentiality. But in your situation here at this clinic, there's no reason I would share this information with the government or, or anybody else other than people indicated. the rest of the people here to treat you. And if you wanted to release the results to somebody, you could sign a release I would let them have the results.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-2): Well, I'm worried that I know people are recording me. And I think that that results shows that I know that's happening. And now, you want to make it look that means I have a problem. When I'm reporting what I know is true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I assume you're worried that
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): no, I think that I know these things are happening. But this test says that I'm wrong to think that it makes me paranoid.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, I understand. Okay. these things are really happening. Yeah. Right. But the test is arranged that it's making it look paranoid when you're not exactly
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Exactly. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that would explain why your score is elevated on the scale. Okay. Is that? Is that what you're thinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I do. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And I wanted you to know that. I appreciate you telling me that. Do you think it's possible that it's working the other way around that the test is measuring something that is there?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I don't think so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You don't think so. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I understand that. I'm higher than most people.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you believe their situation is different than yours. Okay, I understand. the last area, the last subscale I want to discuss this one global scale on discuss. Glass subscale is one that's referred to as psychoticism. And there you are at the 93rd percentile. And that's when maybe you can hear things other people hear or see things that people don't see, or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside the norm and can't be supported by evidence. They feel that's happening to you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Are you going to put me away?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): There's There's nothing here that would indicate that I'm gonna put you away or center anywhere. Yeah, I really this The purpose of this is to discuss the results to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you. we're gonna provide treatment to impart based on these results.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sometimes I hear things other people don't hear.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, this is a this is a score that makes makes sense to retake the test might be right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=com] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Maybe that's true. Maybe that's true. Okay, but I am being recorded,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but you believe you're being recorded, you're starting to that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): close to normal.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, a little bit higher than we want to see.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Me I don't to go out much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): at the Paranoid if that if that scale was accurate, in your estimation, your global severity might be lower, I think, yeah. Closer to the 50 percentile, I think. So, even if you were closer to the 50 percentile, you can To understand how we're concerned that your symptoms are somewhat severe, and we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that. Sure. Is that okay?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It is. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I will meet with the counselor that will be treating, you're here, and I'm going to go over these scores now explain to her what you've explained to me. Okay, in terms of why you think you might have received the score. Okay, I'll go over that with her. And of course, you could discuss it with her too, and she'll have the results of this test in your chart.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay. She's not going to record our session.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): She, she's not going to be recording. Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It does.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. I appreciate you allow me to go over this set of results with you. And I'm going to show you assigned to that counselor and we'll move forward with treatment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Thank thanks, Peggy.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Charles, it sounds things have been going pretty recently,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): but they've been going better. Yeah, they have good I did call a friend. And we had lunch. I'd seen this guy in two or three years and it was good to see him when we contacted again and agreed we maybe have lunch. From time to time, that'd be good. And I got back in the kitchen, I made this pretty good soup. It's an asparagus potato soup that sounds very it's it's really good to chop up the asparagus and the potatoes and one small onion and boil them and then use a blender to give it a real nice texture, texture a little bit split pea soup, sounds good without a split pea and on. feeling some better.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's good. That's good. Charles, I'm proud of you for taking the initiative. Because I know it's been difficult in the past and you've really championed the things we've talked about, and I'm really proud of you for that. One thing you didn't mention was the woodworking shop that we've talked about in the past is that has that been?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, that's still a mess. Okay, in fact, it's a it's a it's it's a big mess. It's such a mess that I really can't get in there and do any work. I haven't done that for some time. Okay. Every surface every why we got to work benches and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Kinda Okay, as we've talked about in the past, it's really difficult to get started on some things that we've avoided for quite some time. So, in the past, let's brainstorm. Try to figure out how we can get some some movement in the woodworking shops. That sound good. Sure. Okay, one thing we've discussed in the past, Charles is extremely important is what you're thinking about as you're going into the woodworking shop. So, what are your thoughts? When you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop? What do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, when I stand there in it, and I feel helpless, I mean it. It's hopeless, it seems to me that okay, get it back in shape again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, let's explore that. So. what's the evidence that it's hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, the mess that it is. I mean, that how disorganized and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it sounds you're saying then it's disorganized. And it's a mess. how do you feel when you think about the woodworking shop that way?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): hopeless, okay, I think
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. it prevents you from getting things done is what you're saying? Yes. Okay. Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way to Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I'm probably They're not gonna do anything, which makes sense. So, what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop? That would be helpful? What's another way?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, if I could get one workbench cleaned off, okay, I would have some space to work on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's a really good start.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, I could make some things that I've been thinking about making for some time. Okay, I kind of have the plans in my head. Okay. I've thought about a medieval, kind of small medieval catapult for my grandson. And maybe Boomerang made out of really nice laminated wood, that would be cool. And I could get one or both of those built, perhaps.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay? And what would that lead to? If you get those things built? What would you have to do anything with those things?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, if I if I built those, I would have to get in the car and drive for hours today. Okay, my grandkids where my grandkids are and to give them the, the toys, okay, and show them how it works and have shown how to throw the boomerang.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): it sounds there's a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids you'd be able to see them and spend time with with them, you'd feel better about going to do that. But you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that what you're saying would Yeah, okay, sure. But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. Right? That wouldn't change overnight. I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids. how about we talked about the first step, which sounds would be to move things off one bench? Does that sound right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that Yeah, one.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=acak] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. That sounds great.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Though.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): let's talk about that. Then let's let's sketch out what each day would look that we won't won't feel overwhelmed we did in the past. let's talk about each day and how we would sketch out each day Does that sound good?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Sure.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): What's the sound to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): It sounds a robot talking. It sounds we need to know this information we need to what do you do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm making some notes. Speaking some weird progress notes Does that worry you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. where your notes gonna go?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, this chart will get locked in the chart room down the hall
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): who has access to the chart room.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Mostly everybody works here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Can I get a copy of your notes after you're done?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does it worry that there's notes?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yes, because I might trust you. And I don't know if I do yet. But I don't trust the other people who work here because I don't know if they're working for the government, which they probably are working for the government. they can have access to all of my notes and the things that you're writing down, which I don't know what they are, because you're not going to give me a copy of it yet. And I don't trust that they can get that information and because they're going to use it to their advantage and they're going to give it to the government, which I can't have that. could you please not take notes?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I could not take notes, what kind of information and notes are you worried that the government's gonna get?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, because I made my room at home government proof, I think they're going to try to steal that technology when I create it that they can then disrupt my room and then everybody else's rooms who are mine that they can then use their mind control to then control me to do the things that they want me to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): without the protection that your house offers, they could control your mind.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Correct. Without my room, and without the technology and the systems and the things that I created, then the government will be able to control everything that I do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All right. can you tell me about your mood through all this, this sounds really stressful you're describing environment where the government's frequently Looking at what you're doing for the feelings are you feel sad or angry?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I feel fine
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You feel fine.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Are you worried that something is going to happen a similar will happen on the bus?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, because I've learned my lesson to not say those things out loud into to talk about what the government's doing because I can't inform anybody else because nobody's listening to me because They're already controlled by the government because they don't have a room I do at home.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): To avoid that in the future, because it didn't really, it didn't really work. You weren't able to, to help them understand what's going on.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): While people don't understand what's going on, then that's their fault. that's their problem. They should have listened to me. And I could gave them the technology that they needed to create the room that the government can't hear them.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): But they weren't open to that idea.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No. Quite the opposite. It is completely opposite.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I talk to people all the time, but they are in my head. We have conversations all the time about how we can make the world a better place and then how we can go through and then destroy the government or do good. pump it up.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Jason Well, I'm sorry to hear that you're under stress. I'm glad to hear your feel it's okay. You're not down or anxious or anything.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Why?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Because you when you bring up children, you haven't time to see the world through their eyes. Or even really listen to them because you're too busy and preoccupied, but then grandchildren come along and more importantly now great grandchildren and seeing the world fresh through these new eyes is it's quite mind blowing actually. I've learned a lot. In the old days, grandchildren used to learn the grandparents knee but nowadays it's the grandparents learning at the grandchildren's knees now definitely Oh, yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. And do you think it also benefits them to spend time with people of different different generations different ages?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, as I said they don't see it use age you see, yeah, which is very releasing. Because Well, it is, you know, after the my generation the way I was brought up, to be seen and not heard and to sit in the parlor with a all these old people. And now, money going around flipping parks, you know, they adventure things and they're saying, Come on the slide with us and all this, you know, which I do. Which I do, I don't turn anything down.

When when do you think that if my generation are living to be 100 and we were brought up with dripping sandwiches, maybe With marbling in blah, etc, etc, full cream milk, all the rest of it. Why get stressed out? You know, eat everything in moderation and enjoy life for goodness sake.

I'm very good at writing letters. I don't send the letter to them. But I do write it down and get it out of my system. And I keep it in a drawer in case one day, I might need to plunk it down in front of them. But it's You know, it's off, it's out of my head. And if I need to go to the doctor about anything, I will write down what I want to say to him, because I don't believe they listen to you all the time, especially a woman, if it's a man, Doctor, but you know, whichever they think, Oh, god, it's her again, you know? I think, put this down and smile at him. He's got to read it.

And honestly, they're like, nine years old. We have the biggest laughs and they do the silliest things and you know, we feel as if we've been set free from actual age You know, you're a mother set an example to the children, right? Oh, you're a daughter, you know?

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I think if you can do something for somebody else for whatever reason, however tiny the comeback to yourself is, is huge. But as long as you don't look for that comeback, but it just, it is Yeah. And it also consolidates the reason why you're still alive that you know that you're not taking up space on the planet. And that, you know, you should do something nice in January hopefully, tanden, Parrish Don't for Alzheimer's. that's the plan we're animating
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): right? To raise money for ALzheimer's without shame this tandem jump out of a player.

Well, one You don't know how long you're here four and two nobody's that important to you know, the world you're not the center of the universe for goodness sake, you know, get on with things and it's like, I feel sorry with Facebook, you know, if they don't get enough likes, you know, it was ruin the day some people well, this is all false. It smoke and mirrors. One thing a friend did say to me that was very important and very proudly was saying that I now own my own house, you see? And she laughed and she said, Do you think it really? night? Yes. You know? Oh, you taking it with you? Oh, yeah. She said if you don't own anything, she said it's smoke and mirrors all of it.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I should just, I should give up and buy some momos and, you know, resign myself to the pack. I'm going to get fat and I'm going to stay bad.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Tell me about some of the foods that you've been eating that have been kind of leading to this problem for you.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, let's talk about for a second. I'd to the kind of your relationship to this problem. How do you how do you view this problem?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): It's disgusting. It's it's slavery. Food owns me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): the the food is in control of this situation?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): sounds ridiculous when you say it that, but that's what it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's in control ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alright. So, now I want to ask you a couple of questions about the importance and the confidence of changing clearly, you have some desire to change or we wouldn't be be here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=1): my god, I would love to Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): if you're looking at a scale of one to 10, one was, it's not important to change and 10 was extremely important change. This is how important it is for you to curtail your eating 10 times very important to you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it's very important
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): very important. Okay. what if I asked the same question except this time? You're confidence. So, one is you're not confident, all you can change, but 10 you're very confident you could change.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I could probably change for half a day. I've done it. And sometimes if I'm lucky, I'll get a week. But overall?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): overall yeah
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): it's impossible. you want a number at zero.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it's below the below the scale of one to 10 this is
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you can have no confidence at all.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I've tried it. I know. I mean, it's beating my head against the wall.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): So, on one hand you'd to, you'd to stop the eating, It's important to but on the other hand, you don't believe you can do it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I can't do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You can't do it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I can't.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it can't be done. Have there been any other changes you have been able to make, say in the last few years that have been positive.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I stopped biting my nails.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you had some small successes in terms of making changes.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What do you think makes the this thought I'll refer to as the food problem much more powerful ? much more difficult to tackle?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I wish I know. I mean, there's many things it's it's everywhere.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): The food is everywhere?

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. How about other foods that could be contributing the problem? Maybe you don't enjoy as much as chocolate.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Oh, potato chips. French fries. Mexican food. What else? Cheese?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Definitely any of the types of candies ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): start naming Skittles, cherry Starburst any candy.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): That's not gonna happen? All right,
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I would love for it to happen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): right, But that's not gonna happen ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I can tell you I don't even want to pretend.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you know that for sure. How about the let's, let's go, for example with the Skittles. What if I introduce the idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): the Candy Skittles ?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that one candy. Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Why bother that? Like, can I not eat Skittles? Is that what you're saying? Like,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you could. It's up to you whether or not but if I introduced that idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles, how would you react to that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't really understand why.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, it represents a change in the direction that you want to move.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): But if I stopped eating Skittles, I'm still going to eat brownies I'm still going to eat. Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): we know we know that scenario that you know, you can't really make a change now from what you're saying. that's the idea of stuffing chocolate is not going over well, with you
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): no, it's not gonna happen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): and that's fine. But the idea of stopping Skittles
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Its fine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that doesn't seem as daunting?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Would you agree still on, say the 110 scale that it's important to stop Skittles?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): How confident are you you could not eat ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): it's kind of funny now you're talking about it, I've sort of wants Skittles more. But, you know, I from now till next week when I come in here, I'd say I am 99% confident I could not eat Skittles and it would not be a major problem.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): this is a change that you think you could accomplish.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Even though you're not sure it'll contribute to solving the larger problem. We know that that's something that that's an area where you don't really see a change as as likely
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): If I don't eat Skittles, this week or even for the rest of my life, is it going to solve my problem? No, but will I do it? If that's what you want me to do? Yeah, that's fine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I would hope it's something that that you would want to do. I mean, what I want is one thing, what you want is really important here. Is this something that mean your Skittles, part of the problem?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): small?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Alrigh. No pun intended, right. But it's a small part of the problem, but you'd agree it's still part of the problem.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Not a huge change. But it's one that we can work on.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And we want you to be able to, you know, genuinely buy into the goal. I mean, if you don't think it's important, we can talk about other areas of change.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, I guess I see what you're saying. I mean, if I'm gonna be completely honest with you, I Well, that's what I'm paying you for. Right? I don't think it's gonna work. I'll tell you that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): right. You think you could stop eating Skittles, but you don't think it's gonna solve the larger problem or lead to?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But that's what we have to work with now. Because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): if I introduced the idea of stopping brownies,
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): no, no, no, sorry.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): let's let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case. You know, it's not perfect. It's not ideal, but it's what you can do. you saw the plan suffer for this week you can week for this week continue eating Skittles.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Now Skittles
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And let's see, let's see how we do with that change.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that seemed to make sense.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): work with that and I'll see you again week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you

Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'm doing all right. not doing too bad. How are you doing Dr. Grande ?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Not bad. Thanks for asking. What brings you in?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper. And she saw out of some of the things that you work on one of them is smoking cessation and it bothers her that I smoke. Um, she has been nagging me for weeks to come in and talk to you. I figured I would kind of come in she would stop bugging me about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you came into therapy today? Because your girlfriend pressured you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, it's it's easier for me if I come in here and talk to you That's it. I can spend 45 minutes with you compared to ours or her nagging me through the week
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, it's covered by insurance. It's 45 minutes of my time, but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): and what she would you to do, and this is her goal, not yours would be to stop smoking. Yeah. Tell me what your goal is?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't really have one. Like, I don't think smoking is that bad. Well, I mean, smoking can be bad, but it doesn't it's never bothered me I I don't know. It's like, I really don't have any goals to come in besides having herself on you may.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): do you have a goal of quitting smoking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, not at all. Now there's I don't know. There's many good things about smoking. I get one what really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me one on one time with the boss. the fact that I can get that time with my boss is make worth it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Can you tell us some of the not good things about smoking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Um, I it's a, it's how I meet people. like, if I like, I'll have cigarettes on me, but like, I don't have a lighter and that kind of keeps me from finishing off the pack. Because I can finish off a pack a day. But if I don't have a lighter than, like, I carry the cigarettes around with me. And then if I see other people are smoking, I can go and ask for a lighter and that's always kind of went away and to get to these groups and I've met many different people from from smoking
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): smoking, the way you're presenting it, there's been a positive thing in your life ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I only do it socially. that's Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Are there any negative aspects to smoking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, yeah, I mean, everyone, everyone knows smoking is unhealthy. But I don't, I don't smoke a lot. I only only smoke from time to time and it's mostly on the weekends. it's like, I don't know, occasionally I go by smoker for the weekends, I might have a cough. Maybe I get a heavy cough on Mondays Tuesdays, part of me is gone by Wednesday. it's not really that big of a deal.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you don't seem you're too worried about the negative aspects ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Now. I mean, the obviously is unhealthy. But one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than giving it up for health reasons. I think.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I wanna ask you a question. I want you to give a response between one and 10 as is called scaling And it's to do with the importance of stopping smoking. one would be, it's not important to, and 10 would be, it's extremely important to you, where do you think you'd put that number?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I don't know. Maybe like, a two. it'd be cool to get rid of the cough on Mondays but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from smoking.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): not particularly important?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Now, let me ask you the same question except instead of importance, how confident are you about confidence? How confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale of one sound one being not confident all and 10 being extremely confident.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): I could say probably an eight or nine I could I could give it up I gave it up recently for a month and I didn't even crave it but eventually seeing all my friends got smoking I missed that. I started off again, but I don't know if I if I really wanted to give it up. Forget I'm sure I could
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): stopping smoking is not important to you, but you're fairly confident you could if you decided to quit. So, based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem you're interested in stopping smoking, what would be a goal? How could we spend this time that it would be productive?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): I don't know. Like, I guess it would It would help to be able to, explain to my girlfriend that the stuff that I get from smoking and you You seem you kind of seem you get it like, I don't know, maybe figure out ways to explain to her the things that I get from smoking to like, I don't know kind of help her realize why I do it other than to kill myself.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): to help her to understand why smoking works for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): That's that's one goal than any other goals you could think of I mean, you came in, in part because you're well, that seemed to appear you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): any other relational goals you might want to work on there?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, no, we haven't really been we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking. I think like, maybe figuring out ways to maybe communicate better or having good fights in a way I don't ascribe that but having fights that are productive that don't always end with us going our separate ways or one of us leaving the house but like, I guess being able to wrap up a fight it doesn't last for days.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): productive communication and productive arguments
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=general) (Emotion=0): She understands how important it is to you
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=general) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Because it does seem it's really important to you. But another would be to work on your relation, your relational style, that you, you can end argument and feel you're not at a stalemate?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=1): Yeah, yeah, I think that'd be cool.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All right. Well, you want to make those two goals. We work one we can spend this time going up too fast.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I can do it that it's kind of killing two birds with one stone.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that make sense to me. Well, that's what we'll do. what I'd to do, I'll see you again and about a week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): if you could reflect on some of these changes you think you can make with this relationship where you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator. Because a lot of this revolves around communication.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): communicating the advantages of smoking, but also communicating in the arguing, that you have productive end to these arguments, right. it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=1): Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. We can do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. if you could work on kind of thinking that through, and then next time we meet, we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to to meet those goals.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Right. All right. Sounds good.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. Thanks for coming in Kylie.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thank you.
Summary: smoking can be bad, but it doesn't it's never bothered me like I don't know. I get one what really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me like one on one time with the boss. I can finish off a pack a day. Because I can finish off a pack a day. Because I can finish off a pack a day. But if I don't have a lighter than, like, I carry the cigarettes around with me .

<PrimaryTopic: Anxiety> <SecondaryTopic: nan> <GlobalEmotion: -0.65>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): So, good to see you again. Last week we're talking about anxiety. Do you have your diary card?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, let's look at it real quick. Bring it over here.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, anxiety is really high. What happened yesterday anxiety is really high can be quick summary
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): anxiety is always really high. But yesterday was the worst.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): why?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): We were driving. My dad was driving and I was in the passenger seat and we were in a lot of traffic and that, you know, that already makes me nervous. I to be on time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I know
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't want to be late because then what if I get in trouble. it's already kind of on edge. And then we passed the accident that I guess was causing off the traffic. And there were two cars and they were like, mashed together accordions, and there was a tarp. And I know that under that tarp, there was a dead body, and the car went right. by it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): That's scary.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): This horrible
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): kind of explains that number. ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): yeah. Who wouldn't be anxious? That's a normal thing because there's a dead body.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Well, I'd be anxious Of course. And it's kind of scary to see that. And what else did you think when you saw that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): Who would drive when there's two cars mash together accordions on a dead body? That's insane. You have to be insane to drive.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And your family wants you to learn to drive this year because you're 16
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): they're insane.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And yet, you all you you keep complaining how you live in the middle of nowhere. And if you had a car you could like, go see friends more and get out of your lame Old Town and get to go do fun things.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-2): I can't see my friends anymore if I'm dead.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): True. That's true. And I won't get to see you anymore. Because you're dead. You know, I don't treat dead people right. Remember that? Yeah, okay. on one hand, I know the idea of driving is completely overwhelming. And I know you're anxious, all the time.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): And I get that I have to drive because you're right. It's the middle of nowhere. And I can't just, like, not go places, but
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things you're talking about to help reduce your anxiety. Maybe that's one idea to help you be able to get in the driver's seat. What do you think? So, essentially, you're practicing getting the driver seat by doing this treatment and get in the driver's seat of your anxiety, as opposed to being a passenger and you're letting anxiety outside really your life? Because that's what you're doing. What do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): There's a lot of puns, Jen.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm punning ain't I? So, here's an idea. Let's get on board. We start treating this anxiety. We do it really, really good. job at it we work hard. And idea driving might not be quite as scary. And let's face it being anxious driver increases your risk accidents.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, that's helpful. Thanks.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): reducing your anxiety, It's gonna make you a safer driver.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Yeah, but all these things you keep telling me that I have to do to be less anxious. They involve feeling really anxious.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): True.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): there's no way to can't you're supposed to make it go away. You're not supposed to make it worse to make it better.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): here's what's interesting. You're really good at being really anxious. you'll be really good at this. And it will go away. I promise you, I totally promise you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): That's soo hard.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You know, done well, I'm the expert here of treating anxiety, and I promise you it will get better. I know everything. I know this. What do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I think it sounds really hard. It's really hard.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All I do is totally, totally hard.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Maybe it's not there. Same thing that you have to be more anxious to be less anxious.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I know. It isn't. It's pretty insane, isn't it? I agree. Well, another option is you could be anxious the rest of your life. Do they have a bus where you live?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, you know that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): live with your parents for the rest of your life. I know I forgot. you can live with your parents for the rest of your life. Because you're too anxious to leave town you won't be able to drive. you could live with your parents be anxious all the time, and you could go home ideas on how to maintain your anxiety the rest of your life. You won't need to learn to drive. I mean, your parents are fairly nice. They probably drive around for the rest of your life, you know, until they pass away or something. In the meantime, what about that? forget the whole treatment. I'm pushing you too hard. Why don't we talk about how to maintain your anxiety? You're good at it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Jenna's thats not funny.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It's not meant to be funny. What do you think ?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): that's horrible,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I really want to help you. I know being anxious every time Really hard. one of the options is to really become good at being anxious, and do okay, and learn to sit with your anxiety. And another option is Yeah, getting more anxious to reduce your anxiety.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you're saying that no matter what I choose, it's going to involve feeling anxious.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. For your practice at it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-2): Well, I mean, if those are the only options, might as do the one that's gonna make it eventually go away rather than be there forever.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All right. Do you want to review what some of the treatment strategies will be?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, let's do that.
Summary: What happened yesterday anxiety is really high can be quick summary anxiety is always really high. Yesterday was the worst. We were driving. My dad was driving and I was in the passenger seat and we were in a lot of traffic and that, you know, that already makes me nervous. Who wouldn't be anxious? That's like a normal thing because there's a dead body.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I you know, I know. We've talked Before I think that I'm gonna that I am gonna commit suicide.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You want to commit suicide? You know how you'd do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, I have some pills in my house in the medicine cabinet, and I'm going to take those.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): When do you plan on doing this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Probably a couple days from now. I have some things to get an order. I want to, you know, arrange things and make sure that, you know, everything's in order and then, and then I'll do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What kind of things to to arrange?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Um, you know, I want to make sure that all the documents my husband's going to need that they're in a place that he can find them. Not going to tell him but I want you know, I don't want to make things more difficult for him and that kind of thing. You know what I mean? Like, make sure that everything's in order that when I'm gone, everybody has what they need.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Jill, you've been seeing me for almost a year now and you know, by telling me this, that I'm gonna act to stop you. But I'm gonna try to stop you from killing yourself.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Mm hmm. Yeah, I mean, I want to do it. I think in the end, it's, it's what's going to make things better. But I guess there's still a part of me that doesn't want to die doesn't want to do that to my family. I guess I'm telling you, because you know, I'm not 100% resolved, and I guess I wanted to talk it over.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You seem pretty serious, though, about your timetable in your plan.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. I mean, you know, it's like, when you plan to go on a weekend trip, you're pretty sure you're going to go but if the weather's bad, you might not I think, you know, I'm pretty sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Is there anything that can stop you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-1): Um, I don't know. I don't. I think I mean, I feel pretty sure about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Do you feel it's the depression or something else that drove you to this decision?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I feel I feel like, um, it's just, you know, the same old things that I was worried about before, you know, the depression and, and, you know, my relational issues my job, the stuff that, that gets me down, and, you know, it clicked and it was like, you know, I've thought about it before, but like, I I feel I'm gonna feel better. I feel it's gonna, it's gonna, I'm gonna feel better so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): as you said, it's a solution.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I know we've, we've talked about this issue in the past, right? And when you've come in feeling this way, kind of resolved harming yourself. We sent you over to the hospital. I know that's not your favorite place. But when you go there for however long it's been usually what five days come out feeling a lot better.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Do you feel this time would be different?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, I feel in the past, you know, I've I've been thinking about killing myself seriously, but now, I'm not as scared of it. I don't really want you to put me in the hospital because then I won't be able to do it. And before I was scared, I wanted you to put me in the hospital. But now I want to get it over with and I really don't want you to do that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I say, a part of you saying that. You don't want me to stop you. But yeah, you came in here and you told me, part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): I say, a part of you saying that. You don't want me to stop you. But yeah, you came in here and you told me, part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): hasn it helped you gaining clarity?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't know, I guess. I guess I see that you're saying that like, I really need to go to the hospital. I guess I was hoping a little bit that you would be happy for me that I was feeling better. But I think that you want me to go to the hospital. I don't know. It makes me think about whether it's the decision. You know,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): mean a suicide?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Sometimes and you know, you've been with me, I said about almost a year now and you've been depressed much that time. And it's not unusual. When somebody thinks they found a solution to depression, even if that solution something that I am against, suicide, that their their mood would become elevated because you see an end to pain. There's other things we can do and have done the past, try to get you out of pain.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): But we have done them in the past and I didn't feel better and now I am feeling better. you know I I want you to accept that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But I'm not going to it's my obligation with it I'm happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive. I've seen you this way before and I know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from a suicidal thoughts and feelings you did for weeks, sometimes months at a time. You're seeing really the darkest when you're in the
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, but I'm feeling better now.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Temporarily, because you feel you found the end to the pain which I understand. I mean, Understand you feeling better, but you're feeling better because you plan on killing yourself. And we've talked about how devastating that would be to your family, right? your friends.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I am torturing them with my sadness, I'm making their lives miserable. I don't understand how it's gonna help them for me to stay alive. You know, I'm worth more, they can have my life insurance. And, you know, I won't make them suffer anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): your logic is that if you end your life, you'll freed them from having to deal with
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=1): Yeah. And feels the thing to do
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And as you know, I mean, you've signed releases, I've talked to your husband, your parents, they've repeatedly said that, despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression, they would much rather Have you alive, Why would they say that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I think that they're scared of the pain of losing me, but I know that they'll feel better eventually.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): they'll feel good over the grief?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I understand.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): And I think that they'll understand that I needed this.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You know, I've been doing this for a while. Right. I think we've come to have a good relationship.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And I would hope that I've earned your trust and you value my opinion. We'll do something that I know about suicide. You open to hearing it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): There's a lot of ways that people die. Right. And it's, it's really what eventually will happen to us all. It's hard for me to imagine way more devastating than suicide. Meaning when somebody dies of an illness, or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident, people grieve, right? But there's usually not a blame assigned to that mean they don't feel guilty. Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): They feel sad because they've lost the person, but they don't feel responsible for that person's death. Suicide is different, when somebody commits suicide, their family and friends feel responsible. They have no answers to all the questions that they have. They could never get an answer.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'm gonna write them a note and tell them everything and tell them it's not their fault because it's not their fault and I want them to be happy without me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you believe the note will take away all that pain?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): No, but I think that it will help them realize that they shouldn't feel guilty, you're saying
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=general) (Emotion=0): it'll mitigate that pain?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. I can tell you from experience that notes, notes don't really help. If anything, it's another artifact that they can agonize over. I know it's hard to see from your perspective, because you're kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain you want now, but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their lives, because they've lost you. And it's a it's a special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someone's death. I know you don't want that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't know why you can't let me feel better.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I know it's frustrating. I know it's hard to understand. The times when you've gone to the hospital before, you have felt better. Your outlook was completely different, not 100%. But it was completely different when you came out. I mean, you're still a little down, but nowhere near the depression we'd want to hurt yourself. Is it possible if you go to the hospital this time, you could come out feeling better again?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yeah, It's possible.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm gonna make arrangements to get you out of the hospital. I know. I know you don't. And we've had this conversation before. Right? I realized that, you know, you're not happy with some of the conditions there. But you usually talk finally about the groups. Right? You usually do in the groups. And typically, well, every time right, every time you've been in the hospital, you've come out feeling better. I know it's not what you want to hear. I know you want me to be happy that you're gonna enjoy life, but that would make me happy. That would make anybody happy. I know you think it would make you happy. But I can tell you it's not the answer. I'd you to go voluntarily through this process. Will you do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Lets go
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. I'll go make those arrangements and we can show you. Okay?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay.
Summary: this is a classic love story between a woman and a man . it is more about the passage of time. patient feels the same old things that I was worried about before, you know, the depression and, and, you know, my relational issues my job. therapist knows, patient signed releases, therapist talked to husband, parents of patient, they've repeatedly said that, despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression, they would much rather Have you alive,

Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): rough time of things?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): what was causing it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Not really. I mean, it's the same except one You know, like, I I feel what's the point? I don't feel continuing on.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): You don't feel continuing with your life.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, kind of
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Have you been having thoughts of suicide?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, I think about what it would be to end things. I think it would be a lot easier. But at the same time, like, I can't imagine doing it. But you know, I can't say I haven't thought about it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you have some thoughts about it, what prevents you from doing it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I mean, I guess I know what it would be for my family. I don't want to hurt them.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): They would be hurt?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes and it's scary, I mean, the thought of dying is scary, but the thought of going on is painful.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it almost sounds as if by squaring it down a bit.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=general) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I kind of feel I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't know where to go from here.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Have you worked out in a specific plan or so?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, I mean, you know, you know, I thought if I were to do it, you know, ways but not not specific because I don't think that I could do it, you know, like, I don't. I thought about suicide, but I don't like, seriously consider it as an option. But it's starting to creep into my thoughts. And it never has before that I'm like, kind of concerned about that. Like, I guess I know. Sometimes people really planted and but for me, I've it's an I've never really considered it before it's really scaryfor me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): So, this how long been going on this feelings?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Um, I think in the past couple of days, it started you know, more and then today, it was the first thought in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about it and that's why I wanted to see you because I'm feeling I'm starting to feel a little bit out of control.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, and today and maybe the past few days been kind of new feeling that a new thought you don't want to continue life continue living. But at the same time, you don't want to commit suicide. You don't have a plan.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I don't want to I, I really don't want to but, you know, I said, I feel I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place it. It's not, I know it's not a good option. I Sometimes I feel I'm stuck. I don't know where else to go.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): if, we'll call it feeling depression, right, because that's what we've talked about before, is the depression will go away? Do you think that would change your outlook on?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Definitely, I think that is the reason why I, the reason why the thought of not living anymore comes into my head is because of my depression because I feel like, my emotions are out of control, because I wake up feeling down and useless and pointless, that it makes me wish that I was dead. But if I didn't have that feeling, then I wouldn't wish that I was dead. Because I know that my life has value and I know that my family would want me around and I know there's a future for me, but my feelings make me feel my future is dark and pointless
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): these suicidal ideations I know you're, you're telling me you haven't had them before, I can appreciate that they're scary. They could be scary, even if you hadn't had them before, are fairly common with depression. And you've, it sounds what you're really saying is you're frustrated, and you're tired of being sick. And I think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if you happen to regularly talk about your family before and it would seem to be very upset. When I see your life has value. I want to try to hang on to that thought. After we're done here today, tell me what you have planned for us today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I didn't I didn't really have plans because I kind of you know, came here feeling I really needed to see you I kind of put things on hold but I mean, I guess I would go home and, and, you know, I'm not really sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Anywhere else you will go?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No. But, I mean, I probably could go to my parents house if I needed to, I could probably call them in and see, you know, it's getting close to the afternoon they get off work soon.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Can you do that for me? Can you go there?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And we'll kind of play by here from that point. I'm going to see you today. We'll we'll do some work today. Well, I'll see you again tomorrow. All right. if you could spend a night there that that would be a wiser choice, given your thoughts and your feelings now. Have you ever haven't used the term contract for safety?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think you mentioned it before. I'm not really sure.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. what it means is you kind of an only if it's authentic, I want this to be true is kind of where you promised me that you're going to be safe until I see you again, for the foreseeable future that you don't have any intent or plan to harm yourself. Can you make that promise to me now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. give me a minute and I'll come back and overcome a bit today. And now I'm going to schedule you see tomorrow as well.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0):

Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-3): I think if I was able to get the same thing,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how do you think you might be able to do that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Like, this is how we would do it with CBT we would change your thought. what He gets upset with you and calls you selfish. You start to feel selfish.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): how could you not feel selfish? Even if you changed your thought?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean if I never even thought that I was selfish then I would have been angry.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): do you think you're selfish?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Maybe the time I did die and I felt awful but now he says the wording for money but we're really not one might want to pay our bills or I want to do things i mean he's kind of a cheap person. We have plenty of money to we're not hurting at all and I do not feel confidence I don't think it was selfish to make myself feel prettier you know? But I think people do have their selfish tendencies.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm hearing you say is you don't think you're selfish at all.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): Oh, I mean, I'm Selfish actuation you don't know if you're being selfish?

They had sold a big house that week, we had enough money for me to afford it. Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): instead of thinking I'm selfish, what could you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): I deserve this and then how me sometimes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I deserve this?

Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if you felt competent about your decision, because you changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you get an angry you would think there's no need for this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): Yeah, I think it would help me realize that that's his issue and not mine
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. how do you think you'd behave them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=-3): walk off, or he will be able to This is kind of what I'm wanting to get to, as be able to suppress it and No, man He didn't deserve for me to hit him. He didn't. He said something that upset me, but no one deserves that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. maybe I'm thinking also that you're selfish when he's getting my back. Could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me, he doesn't understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this. And explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, yeah, I could try that.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-3): And I think also, he understood why I did it.

I think that could be another option. Obviously, when the concerns we have is that we don't want to have you on sleeping tablets for a long period of time because their issues about becoming dependent on them and reliant on them. We can use them for a short period of time, say, for a week to help you get back into a bit more of a normal sleep.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): let's shift it to body where in your body you feel this type feeling?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think it's, it's in my chest.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that's a hot area, feeling around the heart. And what is there in that heart and you pay attention to that, that area in your heart? What What do you find? What sort of thing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes, it's really a compressing feeling.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feelings. And I would to suggest if you can say instead of being it, and see what happens in your body go ahead
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You want me to say, okay, yes. My chest feels very tight. I feel very frustrated, angry, angry.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that's what's coming up frustration, anger. what are you doing this moment with your anger as you said to me here to chest this moment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): accepting it
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): once you accept that anger inside you, what else do you do with that anger having accepted?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's it's noticing you're saying it again.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Use the word Hi. It's a thing that to acknowledge this is, you know, something out there, we do a lot Something very strong. it's a safe way to put it. But if you say I feel angry,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I feel angry.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But who do you feel angry at?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): My ex husband
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You ex husband?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hmm, yup
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Sandra, having explore some of your feelings around the situation you have, I'm going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair. This may be a little uncomfortable. But it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer, and you'll be in dialoguing with a party that you are having to deal with. And I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change process okay. It's been Jeff and your imagination that the massive Jeff we're here. I'll bring a chair. Okay. Welcome, Jeff. I mean I welcome Jeff. And, and there's Jeff. Imagine his face looks how you remember him and bring him in and your fantasy. And then when you're ready to say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneous.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Jeff, I feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the children in. I think you understand how hard it is at times and the things that I have to explain to them about about this situation. It bothers me that you don't go out of your way to spend extra time with the children and I really believe that in the future, they, they will come to, to really resent that and, and not look at you as as their father, I, I honestly can't understand why you don't want to spend more time with them. And irrespective of what's happened between between us and and you moving on and, and forth. I don't think that that your children and my children should really suffer in that way. we'd them to have as as normal a life as possible and, and be able to, to be with both of their parents and why you know what is important rather than them wanting to be with them. It's it's very hard.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay, there's a kind of question you understand why this happened, etc. Right? what next thing we'll do, you'll sit over there, and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at. That maybe a little bit difficult But let's do a dialogue as if he were he's not here anyway.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): we'll, we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, imaginary Jeff, and you in the present here and now. Okay. And what is what is he saying? I know they're the hurts and frustration a but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I really don't have any appreciation for that because the reason the reason that you've given that you're busy, I'm busy in my life and I still give our children priority, they still take precedence in my life. And I don't think that that, that that's
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what kind of father you should be for the children?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You should be proactive in wanting to save them. And I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than then what we have agreed is there are times when when you Want to do something spontaneous and and see then then then feel free to contact us and, and see if it's okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds a very good idea. Good offer you Jeff, are you prepared to take that off for the kids sake? Its great go your way what's what's going on here? The contracts happening okay. Seems Parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important. That's the children. children will not suffer, they will benefit from that agreement, if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how we're going to take care of the children. Because the thing no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple separate together, the contract life countries, I'm still my father to my children as a mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out, we can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together and even if you don't, they don't live together. We would live for the with the kids they'd be happy. Does that make sense to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. This is in a counseling session. And He hasn't really participated in informing his contract.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you hear that this happened for you. And you've done it. is there something that the now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter how he is? Because there's now a new realization that the children need that. Father and Mother. How's that for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, maybe I need to let him know that And extend the invitation of having more time out there. Yeah. Yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're good at that. You're very good. Who's watching you working here? You're very good at creating contracts and very clear about what you want. And it's a question of how you can the two parties can get to that agreement together. What do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Great, because that's, this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen.
Summary: patient feels frustrated and some compression feeling in chest and feels very tight. patient feels angry at ex husband. therapist sugest to talk to husband on an empty chair. patient wants a normal life as possible and dont want children to suffer.

And lately, I've got much work given to me. I'm having difficulty getting through the whole day with it. And I've got a couple of teenage boys that I pick up after school every day because he's naughty. They're not allowed to go on the bus. And I've made my hours 830 to 330. I give them a chance to Get out of school and then at 330 on on supposed to be there to pick them up. But lately, it's been later and later on getting there sometimes 430 the other day was five and the boys were the naughty boys you notice and and they're everywhere. They're all over the school they're getting into trouble and and then I'm late home preparing dinner for my husband and then he gets annoyed and on it goes, it's getting too much.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you're supposed to finish at 330 Why do you think you're not finishing it through 330?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): too much work? And here's what's happening. We'll we'll do one dog work in a doctor's surgery. I don't know if I mentioned that. One doctor employed me but there are four within the practice. And I'm doing work for all of them when really I should only be doing work for one
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): right, that's really the problem that we'll get You work and there's no way you can fit into the the times that you were employed to work.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No. And I can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray. And then and then it's not get into my head try and write those fallen. It's there the next day in. And it's It's all too much for us.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can see that I can see you're getting quite stressed about it. have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this? Kathleen? Is there anything you think you could do?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, apart from I don't I don't believe it's such a good job, but I'll probably have to, I'll have to, I'll have to tell some. I'll have to tell her. I think I'm gonna have to tell her
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you really do feel that you need to talk to the boss that includes you and explain what the problem is. Is this something you feel comfortable about doing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, no, no, no. Oh, she's easy and And she is lovely and I thought I don't I don't want to annoy her.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, because she was lovely there. She says, Do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her, that she'd be quite receptive to listening to you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, of course she, wouldn't she
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay. What I'm going to suggest Kathleen is that we do something called a role play. And what that is, is that we act out the situation, whatever it is. And in your case, it's going to be you going and talking to your boss and trying to explain to her that you've got a problem trying to fit your work into the house, which is supposed to be working. you'll be playing, you end up playing your boss. Now, obviously, you're not going to get exactly the same responses from your boss that you'll get from me today. But it does give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it, to practice it, and to get a response that you can then react to and practice your way through a possible scenario. And what this could do happily Give you a bit more confidence about the swing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What do you put in a?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, we practice it now. Oh, I can, what we'll do is, you'll be you. And I'll be the doctor that you're going to see. Let's think about a couple of things to get it started.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I pretend that I'm going to be coming into her tutorial. Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): well, what do you think would be the best time of day to do it? Oh, topic day
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): time of day. I'm busy busy during the day, I'm probably early morning might be the best first first thing in the morning.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sounds a good idea because then you don't have to worry.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's true.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, have you had any got any thoughts about what you might say? How are you going to introduce?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I suppose I could say to her, is this a good time to talk?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's fantastic.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): because that gives her the chance the opportunity to say well, No, it isn't. Could you come in five minutes. I'm sorry. Oh, Go straight into it. That's really good. Okay. Should we give it a try?
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm gonna get you to stand up and pretend that you knocking on the doors that what you do. Yes, yes. All right. I want you to get out and do that and then come back in as if you're having to see your boss and the boss to tell me what to
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): do the role plays out.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Now good time to talk.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, sure. Good, thank you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, the problem is Marianne on on having I'm having problems coping with my workload at the moment, mainly because it's putting me here, too late in the afternoon. Remember when you first put me on miles were 830 to 330 as well. No, I'm finishing later and later 430, sometimes 5 I've got too much work and a lot to finish on time because I have to pick them up from school and you know what they like. I'm wondering if if we can work
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): obviously you're employed 830 to 330 Kathlleine hours we want you to work we don't want you working back first of all, this is important that you know that we want you to leave at 330 and that's what I want you to do. But from what you're saying the work you're being given doesn't fit into those hours
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what's happening here I'm getting too much work from the other doctors
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): All i don't know i don't think you're not but I didn't think that I'd be getting work of four because this doctors here and is only doing your work.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think I've got the picture.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't I don't saying no to them though.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm glad you came to me. I really need this job. Look. I'm really glad you came to see But obviously 830 to 330 is not enough. It's a long day, early as you're supposed to work. I need to have a look into this and see what's going on.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's only half my day. The other half starts when I pick my boys up. And they say naughty they are they are really well, certainly
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Kathleen. Yes, I'll have a look at it. But I want you to make sure that you do leave at 330 every day.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I think because I've done that little rolle play feel a little bit better probably gone and seen the doctor will help
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Obviously the responses that I gave are not going to be the ones you'll get from doctor because she is sure this is what she said she. there'll be something similar, but the important thing is, I think, to work out that first opening gambit, isn't it and it's true and to do that, and then flow on That's something I want you to think about. Perhaps a few. You guys come and see me next week and about a week perhaps.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I have to sit home.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, let's look at it. What I'd you to do is think about what we've done today. Yes, but but don't don't. Don't overdo it don't sort of keep it down for your mind. Well, exactly. That's what I was going to say. I can see that you're getting a bit, too.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't confrontation. I don't telling people what to do.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know. Yeah. having the words is a help. That will help you to get a bit of confidence there. But importantly, I think we need to relax a bit, don't we? And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you that I'd you to go away and practice. that horrified by next week when you come, you'll practice those relaxation exercises, because they have things that you can use anyway in any situation. I'll tell you what I know you don't have to lie on the floor. Not for these because that's not very practical before you go see your boss. So, what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week's time and your practice the relaxation exercises, we'll go through them again, and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real. What do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's that sounds good. I feel a little bit more relaxed thinking about that actually.
Summary: One doctor employed patient but there are four within the practice . I just can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray . It's just all too much for patient. therapist suggest patient to relax a bit. and tells some relaxation exercises.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hi, dog
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Have a seat. Yeah. Hi. And we talked on the phone.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, yes. I saw Joe Dr. Donovan. Yeah. And he did that scan for gall stones.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. And what happened from there then tell me a little bit about what's happened that I'm up to speed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I went for that scan and then I was a bit surprised actually, they rang me up and a few days afterwards and said that I needed another scan to check things out. Okay, I was there. It was on Monday this week. Don't let anything then.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. in between the scan happening and the second scan happening Was it the department?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, no, it was the it was a nice old sound girl who rang me saying they were booking this disappointments for this extra scan.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): And did they give you an idea why they needed to do extra?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): No, they didn't I mean, I try to ask you always do and play sweet talk lady, but she was not pretending.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. And I do have any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling back?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I guess it was gallstones.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been having them but we do have a scan result here today and there's some scuffs on it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I to make sure that I know what's been happening to you first of all, and then we'll go into detail
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): all started a few months ago Ray with his tummy pain.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And then I saw your colleague, and he said we better get a scan. Yeah, I went for that scan. It was only about two weeks ago. And I got four or five days later. got the phone call? I needed this additional scan. I went on Monday.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay. And do you still have pain at the abdomen?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes. Yeah, it's there all the time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. Well, as I said, you scan result has come through to me today.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm afraid I'm afraid there is something that's potentially a little bit worrying on it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Really?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what's what's the worrying thing that you found?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, if I take you back to the first scan first. what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): suspicious?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen, which is quite closely evolved, right, and called the pancreas. And when they did the ultrasound scan, which is a good scan, but isn't particularly detailed, right, there was something on it that they saw that they wanted a bit more info
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that's why they called you back for the second scan
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): That doesn't sound good, does they?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): which was a CT scan, which is a detail that we're likely to be talking about.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): the second scan, I showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Really?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): When I say something, what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancer
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): god. I didn't expect that. God, I am only 47 cancer.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm really sorry to have to break it to you this, but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you. So, I mean, I know that I've dropped a big bombshell on you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Oh, yes. God
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you got any Any questions in a minute? Have you got anything that you can query?
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What's the pancreas and I have got cancer. What can I can make can they cut it out?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And it depends. And a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen, as I said, and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body prefers the body. Because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem, your pain that you've been getting. that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And the answer is, I don't know what could be done about it. But we need to ask a specialist what we usually do. This situation is asked especially today to see what has happened, think about what was cooking. Right? Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I understand that I've thrown a whole lot of information at you and
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I hasn't expected that so.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I mean, is there is there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them? Oh, quit I went on a bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit. Bit more time.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I mean, I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is. We have to imagine that it is something a cancer until we can prove what is right. we do everything very quickly. Yeah, try and get some answers. Right. But we don't know any definite nothing certain in a minute. But I do appreciate that. I've given you a little bit of time. my door is open and yes. Okay. Have you got any questions?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No.

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): some of it's a little bit a little bit scary. And as I said, we don't know, nothing certain yet. I wonder if you might want to come back to see me. what this does is it explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And it talks about cancer in general. The types of ways in which you can affect the pancreas
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): okay. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): How we do it and how we work out what we do about it talks about the different types of scans that you've had and this one is CTS.
Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And then depending on what they find, yeah, it gives you a brief run through of the different types of treatment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): did you want to have a read through this and then Maybe tomorrow.

<PrimaryTopic: stress> <SecondaryTopic: drinking> <GlobalEmotion: 0.00>
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Hi Miss Clark, My name is Alan Lime. I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center. Dr. Steele asked me if I would spend some time with you today. I'm really glad that you're here. I'm curious as to why he would send you to me.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I came to see Dr. Seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety, that's kind of getting the best of me. And in the course of my appointment with him, he was asking how I was dealing with that stress. And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and, and felt maybe you could help me with stress or something.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. he, he see me because you went to him for increased stress. And he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase And prior to prescribing anything, you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I suppose.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. you filled in one of the Pink Sheets and I take a look at that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): He told me to fill that out and bring it with me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, thank you. So, you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week, you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well. And that you have one or two drinks in one setting
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): typically, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And maybe monthly you have more than that. What what's what kind of drinks do you have? What do you do when you typically drink
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): wine with my meals? You know, again, one or two, typically and more frequently, three or four. My stress is increased.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it's time to increase your strength a little more. Well, based on what you put here, you get it gives you six points on this scale scale ranging from zero to 46 points will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone. if it's with you to talk a little bit about that,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): okay. that was sunset run zero to 40. It's not a sort of super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there, or even stay there. This is a typical standard drink size over here, I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine or not,
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I feel the glass up maybe a little more than that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): maybe the little space it's upset, perhaps a drink drink and a half each one. that also increased a little bit more. perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here. And for women, healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week, seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet, you're perhaps already drinking more than that. what do you make of all that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That news to me, you know, I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy. You know, no more than seven in a week? That seems kind of prohibitive?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it seems seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking. And certainly there's there's conflicting information out there about what's healthy and what's not healthy. Imagine the increased stress work because we're concerned doctor seal as your stress increases, and if you were to describe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two, that would also be a concern for him. I would, I would think, if you would, what is it that you about alcohol?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, you know, it does, at least in the moment, temporarily reduce my stress. And I you know, a good glass of wine. I don't don't drink the cheap stuff. I the expensive.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): See, the taste of it. And it does help to lower the stress, even if it's for the fun of me drinking. What's not good things about alcohol for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, well, you know, the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kinda yaak and, of course, part of my stress is finances. And I mentioned I the good stuff. And if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, kind of defeating the purpose they're
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): the drink introduce stress and increasing stress at the same time. on the one hand, it low is it on the other hand, it's increasing kind of the seesaw teeter totter effect. What do you make of that, given that on one hand, it lowers on the other hand, it increases and and now it's increasing even more?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress. Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Imagine investment thoughts that what have you thought of trying?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I've exercised in the past and that helps. now. My schedule is kind of out of whack and I really don't know what to do. That's why I came to see Dr. seal. I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help. You know, when I'm feeling overwhelmed,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink, the level that you are drinking, that whatever he prescribes you, there may be an interaction with it to mention that he's concerned. I'm not completely sure. you've had some success in the past of changing behaviors. And if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds you could draw upon that to make those changes. How important would it be for you on a scale of zero to 10? I have a low visual hero that if zero is not important, ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I mean, if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking, then it's fairly important, maybe about seven.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's it's pretty up there. What do you choose a seven out of five or four?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, again, I got to get things under control. You know, My kids are dependent on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress. And so, you know, all those responsibilities
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there's a lot riding on your decision on what to do with this. What if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, the you know, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can't afford to, you know, have any more stress. So, yeah,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it. And if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): hmmm
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): How confident are you that you could do something about your drinking?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm pretty confident and you know, probably about a seven or an eight
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it's pretty high up there again, and what if, what if anything, would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit? I'm curious about that
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I you know, I a lot A glass of wine, I don't want to quit altogether, I'd be willing to try cutting that. But now if it's going to, if Dr. Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you'd be willing to stop altogether. That's what was indicated by the physician. Okay. based on that, how ready are you to do anything now, whether it's to cut back whether it's to quit?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, again, you know, if if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress, then then you know, I be pretty ready. Again, maybe about an on that scale, maybe an eight.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's, that's pretty hot there as well. It sounds as though you're pretty motivated to do something about this now, given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point. And on lowering anxiety, in general, it sounds and that's one of your goals as well. Well, I'm pretty confident Once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do, you'll be able to follow through with it. Based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes. I mentioned some things that you can draw upon. What's one thing that you could do? Imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Oh, I you know that the exercise but again, that's that's kind of difficult to fit in now. I'm hoping that Dr. Seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): one of the things we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life, this area of increased stress and sound responsibility there and we can make an appointment for you for before you leave today to talk to somebody
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That would be nice
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that also has some information here if you're interested, some pamphlet on alcohol and and how what helps limits on how it may be affected by medications that you take as well. And I wish you lots of luck. It sounds as though you're really committed to making this shift in this change. And I imagine doctors still want to follow up with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Again, I look forward to speaking to you in the future.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right, thank you very much.

The reason why I'm asking is because in order for us to help you, we want to be able to develop a good support system. we want to, you know, maybe in time will include you know, your mom and let her know and you know, getting some help getting some treatment. But that was, you know, some of the questions I had for as far as you know, your family how you were raised.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): okay. what we want to do is we want to be able to identify, you know, your problem and that's, you know, the marijuana use, maybe what triggers you to go use marijuana and then maybe then begin to identify some of the emotions that are behind it. But you know, you've grown up with six siblings that you all if you go to the same school or your different schools, that becomes a little bit about your, your school history.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, you know, her sister who is one years younger than me, and we were kind of on the same level now. Meet her was at the same school for a while, and she got into this class, right, and it's human to underscore and I was kind of Escobar myself. And I went Rule 70 this was a younger sister.

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Yeah. During high school, I went to seven different high schools. Okay, it's been hard, right, but I'm going to go a little bit there, right. Around two years ago, I got my high school diploma, graduated.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Now in high school, how did that affect you being moved around seven times? What was your foster parent moving you? Did you move physically your house?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, it was when I was 13. I was told, you know, 13 more moved from my foster parents. And when I was 13, I went to a group home. Right. So, you know, when I moved from place to place from Groupon, Groupon, this area of the city would vary. kind of like, the different schools,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. then you had to make a whole new set of friends.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Exactly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that was the challenge with meeting new friends. Not knowing who You know your friends are what they do. Right?

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): spelling, I suppose in every spelling bee room, everyone, but I wasn't every spelling
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): spelling and reading are your strong points. Yeah, that kind of explains why you're cute. You're pretty good. As far as you know, being vocal, you're okay. You'd to talk to people, you engage with people. spelling English, what were some of the classes that maybe you didn't really enjoy? Or you had a challenge with
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): math, science
Summary: Patient usually go with other friends because they were that my influences to begin with. It actually helps him function a lot better. And that was not the right choice or anything like that therapy where I can find ways to find ways. Patient smokes marijuana and mother doesn't know how to do it.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, that's fine. Okay, so, Barbara, I'm seeing you today. But I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you. Is that right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. Dr. Brown is my doctor.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. What is it this boy you see me today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach. And Dr. Brown doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. I thought perhaps I'd come and see you to see if you could help.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. It very often feels bloated. I I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes and other times it stops. It's a real stabbing feeling. I often have the urge to go to the toilet, and and I pass very smelly wind.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): quite a few symptoms and some of them sound more troublesome to you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And how long has this been going on?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea And I don't think my stomach's ever been really since then.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay. you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes,Yes.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay.And What sort of treatments have you tried for this before?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. But I've been to the health shop and and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different tablets and medicines for different things. Now and Imodium, I have Imodium in my hand back all the time, in case, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): these different tablets that you've got from the herbal shop, how are you taking them?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Oh, well, different tablets. You know, I don't have the same problem every day. I'll take some tablets for certain symptoms, right. Other tablets for other things.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): my my writing thinking you perhaps decide on a day to day basis, what you're going to take depending on what your stomach's doing.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): okay. Okay. And what About tests if you have any tests for these problems.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yes, I had in the early days, I had a gastros,, guess.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): they're are the gastroscopy?
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): yes, And at the same time, I had a barium enema, right, that was very uncomfortable.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): But now I've tried you. I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything. He's, he's not sent me for anymore. That's it now, as far as he's concerned, sent me back to the doctor.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. sounds as though you're not happy with that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money out there. And he's decided that I've had enough tests small and you know, if you go on the internet, there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): If I had a bit more money, I'd go Private. I don't think he's got to the bottom of it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you feel as though enough hasn't been done in the way.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): He's not. There's loads more he could do, I'm sure. Right. Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It sounds you've had these problems now for about four years, you've you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. You've tried a lot of tablets, some prescribed some herbal remedies, and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that you've been investigated thoroughly enough. Is that is that about it?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how is all of this affecting you day to day, how's how's it affecting your life?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, it's had quite, quite a big impact. I mean, the first thing the biggest thing, I suppose is that I, I went from being full time to part time at work. I couldn't sit all day comfortably. And in part time, In the end, I hope about a year ago I stopped work altogether, right. I missed that. I missed the girls we used to use least once a week night to the pictures or drink. That's one thing.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That's something you quite enjoyed.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, yes. Yes, we have a laugh.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I used to go to swing in shape. I used to go to an exercise class that was I missed the exercise Actually, that was once a week, but you know, the thing was, I wasn't comfortable. Never felt quite doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was going to be taken shorter I stopped that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Then well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. That's another thing we don't do anymore Now.That's Quite a few things really.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, it does, It does sound as though over the last few years, your life has really changed quite a lot because of the symptoms. It's It sounds you're doing very few of the things that you used to do.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hmm, right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What is it you spend your average day doing now?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I put around the house. I spent perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say draw you in don't do. I read a bit the old magazines but generally I'm at home.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Okay. Okay. And have you been any times of the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Last year My son got married. And I have to say I was worried that that I wouldn't be able to cope with it that I wouldn't be feeling enough. But surprisingly enough, I was in good form. I think it was about three weeks in the summer getting ready for it and the whole heart of the wedding, but I was in good, really good form for that. Yeah. That was a good time.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right. And how were you told me symptoms then?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I hardly noticed them. Yes. It seemed to clear up
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): nice
Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): which was good,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): right, That's interesting And are there any times when you Tummy symptoms bother you More seem particularly bad?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, it's I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. It's particularly uncomfortable. I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He, he travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times A month And that's not very often not good, then I have to say,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you notice it's the worst when your husband's not around.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more. I don't know when he's not there.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Now, you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong here?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, he he thinks it's all in my head. He's he says it's stress.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Um, what do you think?
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I hit too much physical pain for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's it's a real pain.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And if you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, I mean, I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up in the early stages. But I think I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS friend of mines got that and it sounds similar. And then other times, I think, I wonder if it's an ulcer on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): My mother in law my mother in law died of cancer last year and she had a growth the doctor didn't investigate that by the time they found it, it was the size of a football and it was it was too late to operate them. you know, when I go to bed at night now and I feel and make sure there's nothing different going on And yeah, I worry about that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you're, you're kind of prodding having a feel at night to see if you can feel anything.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah. want to make sure there's nothing changing down there You know
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right. Okay. Okay. to make sure that I've got the story straight you've, you've seen Dr. Brown for couple of years, you've tried a variety of medications, some prescribed some from the herbal shop, and none of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations, but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And times you worried that this could be something quite serious a cancer. Is that if I got the story, right,
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yes
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here and you've finished your medical training. I wondered whether you know, with new eyes and new way of looking at at the problem. You probably know about different tests and new tests that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments, that perhaps you could send me for some different tests.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Right. you're hoping that I'd send you four more tests?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Hmm. Well, I think this, there's got to be something that tests might reveal.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right. Okay. Well, I think Barbara having having heard his story and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and they've not shown anything. And you symptoms haven't really changed that much. it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know. it'd be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's like, do you think it's all in my head that you're going to be Dr. Brown, you think I'm imagining all of this?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, I think that you clearly have pain. And it clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability. I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Sometimes these things can go together. I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married, and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and when your husband's away, which is something you don't very much. Sometimes somehow his symptoms then will seem greater. I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara is if the might be some kind of a link with you between how you feel In your mind and what's going on in your life, and and how much you symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm not saying that the pains in your mind. I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really with those, none of those have really helped you. I guess I'm wondering whether now, it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What sort of approach?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life. I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have been Really shrunk down. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of, is that right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Well, I can't do them. Yeah, I can't do them anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things, because you felt you couldn't do them. But I wonder if in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment. And I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Oh, I don't know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day. And maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things. Even if it's meeting up with your female friends once a week. And whether doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. And the fact that you, you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may be making some of these symptoms Worse, I guess. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for, say, two or three months to see whether or not it makes any difference?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What two, three months is a long time if there is something going on, I mean, that's what happened to my mother in law, you know, they they left her and didn't spot it and
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): well, I guess, if we if we did decide to work together this, this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly, we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate proof They stay the same, then, you know, we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing. How would that sound?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, what are you saying then that I should come back and see you
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only begun talk about it. And I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it, and then perhaps come back, perhaps if you booked him for a double slot next week. And that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. And perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them. We can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound Barbara?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, well, to make an appointment for next week, come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, I think so. I think that would be a good, a good start.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking here and bring all the bottles down.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Okay. All right. see you again next week
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'll make an appointment next week.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All right. Thank you Barbara.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): bye bye

Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): that was in your late teens and at the time you took the tablets because you wanted to be dead. Is that right?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay, but you've not wanted to be dead since that time in your late teens?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. Can I ask a few more general questions about your home situation? Who is it Is it is there anyone at home with you?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): my daughter used to live with me, But now she is gone to live with her dad now
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right? she's gone to live with her dad that quite recently
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a year ago
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and what was what was that about?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): she couldn't cope with the fact that I was cutting myself might run into friends. She knew it was happening. And I suppose I suppose one of the big things as as relationships I have
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): the relationships you had?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Can you tell me a bit more about that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): the one we had with Mark, you know, starts off being great. And then I got, I got really scared, really scared that they're gonna leave and then turns into a fights and they end up leaving anyway.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right. And it sounds your daughter struggled with that.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, I suppose she didn't whether she was coming out going really

Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. You've seen Jane a few people in the past you've seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors. As anything that anyone's done for you before been particularly helpful.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I've been crap was Philip being passed from pillar to post.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you've not found anything that people have done particularly helpful in helping you to manage your relationships and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Its llike nobody's listening to me, You know, I think you're the only person who's sat and listened to what I've got to say,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what do you think it would be worse? Given that this this has been such a long standing problem clearly does get gets in the way, quite a lot of aspects of your life. Do you think it would be worth us? meeting again one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What do you mean one more time? Can I see you, you know, properly.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, the way that we work here in this department is that we we see people once or twice and try and think with them about the best place for them to be and then refer them on to the most appropriate parts of the service. it wouldn't be usual for me to see. See you more than once or twice Strain
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=general) (Emotion=0): Yeah I said, You're the only person that's listened to me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know it's very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you're not going to continue to see me but it is the way that we work here is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs Jane. would it be for me to book you in to come back and see me say next week for a second appointment and we can perhaps have a think of where to go from there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): That'd be okay.

Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Likely weed
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Would that be regularly to most days?

Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. Its on a regular basis Andy?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): late the weekend.

Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, I guess the reason I was checking I think we've picked up on is sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are they find if they take certain drugs, it could make things feel a lot worse. I wanted to check. that hadn't been your experience.
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, okay. Appreciate from what you're saying, You're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. I wanted to check with you Do you think it could be due to anything else? And I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences, and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be mentally unwell, and it's worth it whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment.
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, because I'm not ill.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Alright.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): It's them and I've read books on this as well. I don't the government know about the them to know that they do this to loads of people. I don't know how they can get away with it. I have done nothing wrong, I don't know why they're doing this to me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay. Sure, I think I can appreciate that. I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone me might be able to do to help you as a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I don't know. I mean, I want to hear really, because someone warmer, tried to. I don't want to worry about I've tried to talk to her about it. She doesn't understand she doesn't really believe me. I mean, do you believe me?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment, I guess I'm not too sure about is what's causing this and I'm, I'm less sure this is due to MI5 is what I'm wondering, is it perhaps you're not as as you might be at the moment. I mean, we've been through a lot of questions And what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this Someone drink cuz I know your mom is I think she's waiting in the waiting room might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some some proper support. Would that be if I got your mum in?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay,
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): okay, if you want to sit there then I'll get your mum okay.

And then I also thought I shouldn't do anything to put any strain on my heart at all. I don't do much exercise or anything at the moment or other things as
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): and other things, what sort of things you are not doing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): personal things, personal things.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. I guess I'm wondering if you're talking about your sex life there.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Now I feel, you know that I shouldn't do anything that, because it might put too much strain on me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): you're avoiding sex in case that puts your heart rate up.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, How's that affecting things between you and your husband?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): My husband's getting really fed up with it to be honest. He's been really, really kind and really supportive. But I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot now. he wanted me to go to the pub last week and absolutely promised that I would, because I've begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm afraid it's gonna happen. I promised and promised him I go to the pub. And then when it came to it, I couldn't. I sat on the sofa and it started happening again. And then I was worried that if I went to the pub, I'd get ill in the pub. And then it's really embarrassing for everybody. that I couldn't go in, and I think he's getting a bit To the end of his tetanus because it seems to come out of the blue. And I've never suffered from anything this before.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It sounds he's getting to the end of his tether because it also sounds you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well. Julie
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): that I've got the story straight. This all began about six months ago. Before that, had you had anything this?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, not at all. I mean, I think we had a new manager at work, I work in a bank only and then we had a new computer system put in and it became very much stressful for all the staff not me. And that's I can sort of see that I was in a lot more pressure and that could be affecting me.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to make sure I've got the the way around. It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town you had the first of these attacks. And then since then you've had some more and now it's kind of got to the point that you don't want to go out to don't get to town by yourself.
Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): No, I don't want to risk it to be honest.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): You know, you don't go to the pub, not socializing you used to and you avoiding things exercise and things sex and having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah yeah yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay. And looking at your I know, you've had an ECG, Dr. Jones, organized for you a couple of months ago.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What have you been told about the results of that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Dr. Jones said that it was okay. And there were no problems. And, you know, I did feel relief, you know, because, obviously, there's been events in my family, my dad died of one, you know, 72. I'm thinking it must be my heart. There must be something wrong with it now. It did feel pleased when Dr. Jones said that. But on the other hand, nothing's changed. You know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems. Nothing, you know, not getting any help with it. I feel a bit well, I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the same symptoms you kow worse and worse.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): even though the your GP told you there's no, there's nothing to worry about with your heart. Do you still worry that There might be something wrong with your heart?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I can't understand it. What do you think of Dr. Julia?
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think I agree with Dr. Jones. I don't think there is anything wrong with your heart. The reason I say that is that you've had an ECG, which has come back perfectly normal. And usually if there was a problem with the heart the ECG would pick something up. Also, you've got none of the risk factors really for heart disease, because you you don't smoke, your blood pressure, from what I can gather from you notes has always been fine. You're fairly young. Before this, you were pretty fit and active. And also, I know you're worried about your dad having had a heart attack, but actually, he was a lot older than you are. And you're not really in the same risk sort of bracket as he would have been.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't think that there is a problem with your heart. I guess what I'm what Is weather actually, what's going on is a little bit more what Dr. Jones thought weather this, this might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms. Have you ever thought it might be that rather than a heart problem?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I think I've been thinking more recently, it could be because my friend has panic attacks. I've discussed it with her and she said, to be honest, it sounds that. I've always thought it was my heart. And what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing it is.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It's right. Okay. Has anyone explained to about anxiety and panic attacks?
Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I don't really know.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, well, perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear a little bit more about that. What we have on top of our kidneys is two little glands and they called our adrenal glands.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And they produce a hormone called adrenalin. Have you heard of that?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes, I have heard of that
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay. And what adrenalin does is it prepares us for situations of fight or flight? Is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I do. I do. Yeah. I Do
Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you remember what we mean by fight or flies?
Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think like, if you're in a scary situation, you fight or you run away, your body sort of triggers that.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): to do it.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes, exactly. It's what's released to allow you to do the flight or fight response in the adrenaline. when your body needs to get ready to do something, it's surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline gets you ready for action.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): it does things it puts your heart rate up, it makes your breathing speed up, you're ready to run. It can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry. It can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded. But those are the kinds of symptoms that you can get.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): All of those Okay.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens the first adrenaline release Out of the blue, perhaps at times of stress, and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, and you're feeling a bit stressed out and you're in town, it was a bit hot. that may have been what was behind that very first panic attack. What happens to people is that once they've had one panic attack, they go on to have more.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Hmm.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And the reason for that is that once you've had something that happen to you, you're kind of there thinking, Oh, will this happen again?
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Is that something that you are Absolutely sure. I have started to really monitor my heart And when it starts to race, I start to get worried. And then it starts getting faster and faster it does feel that's
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, you describing it Exactly. Julie, that's what we call hyper vigilance. you they're kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart. And for most of us, our heart rate will go up and down all through the day, but most of us don't worry about it, because we don't notice it.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): But because you've had a panic attack you they're thinking, What's my heart doing?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): And then the minute it starts to change, you clock it You notice it, and then you start to get anxious thoughts, you might worry And
Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I really start worrying, thinking thinking, is it going to be now? You know, is my heart gonna stop beating
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right, you get those kinds of anxious and they're very frightening, because you're thinking, Oh, my goodness me could my heart's on that makes you even more anxious, and that causes even more adrenalin to be released.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that makes the symptoms even more pronounced. And then that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you. Does that make sense to what might be happening?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It does make sense doctor
Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): One of the things that you have been doing, which is something that a lot of people with anxiety do is that you've started to, to avoid doing things that trigger it off.
Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Yeah, not walking to town or anything that anymore.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Exactly. And whilst in the short term that sort of alleviates your symptoms, because you don't have to get panicky, what's happening is that the more you avoid doing things, the less likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful, really happens.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Does that make sense?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): It Does. it makes sense
Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Well, if we all started to tackle this as if it was an anxiety problem, there are a number of approaches, we can think about tablets. And we're gonna think about other kind of talking approaches. There are pros and cons to those and side effects and things that we need to discuss. I'm slightly watchful of the time, we seem to be coming to the end of today's session for the appointment, but all right, well, I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week, and look again, more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best.
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): 
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): how would that sound?
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You know, that's fine. That's fine.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Any other questions before we end this session
Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No, I will make an appointment to see you next week
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I'll see you next week.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, thank you, doctor.
Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Pleasure. All right.
Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Bye bye.

Every once in a while, I've been getting a little bit of pain, extending my arm and going back to bending it. Really, that's the primary reason I've come in I've attempted to take a little bit To Tylenol to relieve the pain but it's not really seemed to help much.
