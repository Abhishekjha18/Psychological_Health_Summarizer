I'll be your nurse for today. How are you doing? Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I'm okay, I guess waiting for the stitches to come out and be nice. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Oh, what happened? Oh, God. Can you tell me a little bit more about this firefight? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): kit storytime you're ready for this. brown my girls having a fantastic time looking off on fleek and fish. And then this girl, she has the nerve to stare at me from across the room. It gives me kind of kind of this. And then she comes up to me, she bumps into me spills my drink. And she comes up and then she's like, a man. I'm like, excuse me. obviously I pushed her she pushed me kind of thing. And yeah, one thing led to another I it's a it's a blur from that point on but all I know is cops showed up. I'm here and I have this to deal with. Fantastic right? Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): from from what I'm getting here. As you were intoxicated at that point in time, and you had a conversation with this girl, which led to the firefight, Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Miss Allison or the toxic get out smashed, should have seen it. But like, this type of thing doesn't happen often. I don't want you to be sitting here and referring me to some aka because Yo, I'm not an alcoholic. Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, it seems you get offended and feel offended. being referred to it. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, exactly. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Right. Yeah. All right. Well, we do have some time now. If it's with you. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, sure. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Sure you what is drinking do for you? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, you know being 25 that's what we do. we get together we hang out we get a couple of drinks. It's me and my girls. We do this all the time and I love this. It breaks the ice when we go socialize. So, meet new people kind of thing. You know, girlfriend circle. It's fantastic. And it definitely relaxes me after a stressful week and my weeks are stressful as I need this, you know? So, I mean, yeah, but you know, I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, to me, it seems that drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends. It's your way to socialize and it breaks that is right, it helps you socialize and, you know, I'm I also wanted to say that it's very responsible of you to be drinking and not driving. Thank you. How has it affected your life? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Who hasn't? Well, I mean, none of this happens and you have it because of that firefight. And he's gonna be disappointed. Sorry. I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry, it's been great, fantastic. But he says that when I drink, it's like, I'm not myself. It's somebody who's never met before. And obviously, you can imagine the arguments, the fights, and my god, all that stress. It's just, I love them much, but you know, but it's a stress and it's like, I don't forget to make it. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): for my understanding, drinking, it helps you socialize with friends, it relaxes you. It's, you know, your way of just, you know, it breaks that ice for you. On the other hand, it's causing that a lot of arguments with you and your significant other Henry. Yeah. And it's causing a lot that all those arguments are leading to a lot of stress in your relationship, this kind of stuff. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, I mean, we're engaged in this as well. you put it that way, I mean, worried because what's he going to think of you later on in life? What's he going to tell our children? Oh, your mom's an alcoholic. She drank this and they got into fight. I don't want I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way. But at the same time, I mean, I don't want to quit cold turkey. I mean, you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it. But I love him much. I mean, I would do anything for him. And he's going to be disappointed in me hasn't even seen him like, I don't know, how can I face them? Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): This seems a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much. Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Boy, seriously, he's not gonna find anybody that loves him. As much as I do. Trust me on that is not going to happen. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): what I'm getting here now is that if you do want to quit, yeah, yeah. And it's partly because this alcohol is divided into the arguments with Henry and his positive SSL relationship. Yeah. I know we spoke about earlier and I know you don't really the idea of it but what do you know about it? what's your one shed some light on that Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): it's a place where alcoholics go to discuss their problems and I said, I'm not an alcoholic. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, you're a different multiple philosophy life and this share the drinking stories, and everyone kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. Okay? I know you don't want to join a at this point in time 10 times but hypothetically speaking, generally consider joining it maybe later on down the road. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): If this is what I have to do to get my guy back and I'll do it. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, on a scale of one to 10 being for sure. And one being not really sure about it at all. What would you say where you are on the scale with God any? Patient [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You put it that way? Everything I told you, I would say Six, Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): six. Yeah. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Well, it's all about, it's all about Henry at the end of the day, it's it matters to me if I want to keep this engagement, and I will do anything for that man. of course, this is what I have to do in this. This is him. Let him tell you, his relationship with me. And I'm with him is much more important to me than drunken nights at a bar. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I love you, man. I said. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'll tell him that. Therapist [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. now we're sitting at a six or what needs to happen. Maybe we can jump that money or nine, Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): um, you know, like, flexible hours, maybe that isn't even an option. Um, also, maybe there's maybe there's a place nearby somewhere nearby My house, I'll be great. I have to use gas because it's expensive already to go to work and it's far anyway. And I'm like, I guess, I guess it has to do with attitude as well. I don't want to sit there in a circle this and somebody judging me because the way I look in my drinking habits and all that, I guess I'm looking for a good vibe, you know, I don't want to be judged or labeled. Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Now, all of these are very understandable. I mean, it's Of course, you want some in a meeting to be close to us. You don't have to commute far. And yeah, we all have very busy schedules. Now the fit is very busy schedule. It definitely makes sense. And of course, the environments I mean, if you're not happy, they're a human a learning environment. If you're not comfortable there, then it's very hard for you to you know, to be in that environment. Yeah. blotchy today, I was wondering if it's with you, I can give you this for sure. It's for a median. You're really close to your location where you live, okay, and my number is also on there. Give me a call if you have any concerns. And also, I want to thank you today for sharing me your stage of drinking. And I know it's not, you know, easy to notice. No, it's a very sensitive subject. Yeah. I want to thank you Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): . Thank you for listening to me. No one's has sat down and talked to me about anything. I feel you shed some light on an issue. thank you. You're very welcome really means a lot. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're very welcome. And if it's with you, perhaps we can schedule another follow up meeting. I'd say about two weeks or so. Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah, that sounds fine. Yeah, that's okay. Two weeks work. Two weeks. Yeah.\n",

The patient is asked about community where different people share the drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. The patient says a six on ten for joining that community. The patient finds hassles in joining community in terms of flexible hours, reaching the place if it is far away, and also people judging the patient looking at their drinking habits.

Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I am All right, I'm a little bit stressed out now. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Little stressed, What's going on? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, as you know, I'm in a graduate program now. And I'm really coming to the near the end of my program and I'm finding it increasingly difficult. I'm really stressed with how things have been going. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, we've talked about some different struggles you've had as you balance work and school and everything. What specifically is bothering now it seems you're a little more distressed today. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I don't I don't, I don't really know. It's I am, as I've told you, before, I take school really seriously and I really strive to do well, in school and on my assignments and I feel I'm not performing, as as I needed to Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what kind of grades you've been getting lately? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Well, I've been getting A's, Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): anything else? Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): No Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. That's usually considered pretty good, right? Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. I feel it's getting harder to get the As Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): okay, you're working hard to get the same grade? Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right, It used to be easy for me to do what my teachers expect and to get good grades. Now I feel it's, it's really a struggle and I'm not doing as as I need to and I'm constantly worried about not doing this well. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you been getting any feedback from professors or your classmates about your performance? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): My teachers all seem to think I'm doing well. They I see To get good feedback on my assignments, but I feel I feel I to make sure I'm doing well. I really focus on the details making sure that the instructions are really clear, I'm doing everything, perfectly as an Instructure instructor wants because I'm really afraid that you know, if I'm not really clear on what the assignment is, then maybe I won't do it the way. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, before when you got A's you were working hard to have a job but not to the level of precision in terms of the detail in the assignment that you are now. You're trying to get more information about the assignments, you're working harder to get the same grade that used to get before Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I find myself emailing the teacher almost obsessively, trying to, to clarify the assignment and to make sure do they think I'm doing in class and and what not. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): when you're when you're having this feeling that I guess it's a feeling of anxiety or stress, yeah. What's going through your mind? What are you thinking about? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Well, I guess I'm feeling that, you know, I've worked really hard, this whole program and I don't want to mess it up now or, you know, because if I don't get these grades, and I feel what was the use, if I met, then I'm going to be ruining all this hard work, that I've done this whole program if I kind of, if I don't maintain that level of, you know, you said, precision, I feel that I've let myself down or that I'm a failure because I'm, I slacked off at the end of the program and it's close to being done. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what grade would you have to receive for you to feel you have failed Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): probably less than an A. Anything other than A Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): below an A isn't A minus? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I guess I would be with that, but I wouldn't be really happy with it. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): What about A plus? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I wouldn't be that excited about that. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): a B? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I wouldn't be happy with that. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, no, it'd be worse. Okay. an A you can tolerate an A minus you're not exactly sure but you think you could Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yeah. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But a B plus and a B? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): to me like, an A minus I would maybe be with but like, below that to me a B, whether it's a B minus A B, A, B plus it's all B, and that's not an Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what would it mean to you if you received a B? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): that I didn't try hard enough, but there's something else I could have done to to do better that I was like, slacking or I didn't read the directions or I didn't have enough responses or make my paper long enough. I didn't do enough. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you didn't try hard enough that you didn't do enough. What would it mean If that were true? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): If I didn't try hard enough that I was lazy. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That you were lazy? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah, that I could have tried harder and I didn't. why didn't I try? I didn't, maybe I didn't care. I was lazy. Kind of what's the use? If you're not gonna try your best and why try it all? Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, now we we've talked before about automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions in other sessions and one of the cognitive distortions is this idea that unuseful type of thinking and Aaron thinking is when you think of everything in terms of like, Black or White, all or nothing? sounds you have a little tolerance for an A minus you're not completely there. But generally, it's kind of an A of some type, right? Or you're not interested. Right. we get down to you didn't try hard enough and if that were true, the new would be lazy. Right? Which, you know, having senior these last few sessions is clear to me. You're not lazy. But that's the body. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Now, it seems that earlier in your earlier years in the program, this was the Acer effortless for you, but you'd have to work as hard for them. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what's what do you think has changed? Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I'm not quite sure. it didn't stress me out as much in the beginning of the program. I really school. But now I feel I'm static because it's anxiety producing for me because, you know, I'm constantly worried Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You mentioned part of it was you can get close to the end, right. is there anything else? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=-1): Well, the only thing I can think of is we have the same students throughout our program. But I guess this semester there's a new student in the program and I know that you mentioned and it seems she's kind of really stressing me out. And also see throughout the program, I kind of considered myself to be the student who got the best grades and there's this award at the end of the program for doing really well. And I kind of made it a goal of mine to get this award at the end because I felt that would show that I really tried hard this program really meant a lot to me. I think You know, it would show people who viewed Did that, you know, I really busted my butt and, and did a good job in this program. And for the whole program far, you know, that was me that was I was kind of the front runner, I guess for this award. And this semester, there's a new student and then come to find out she had a 4.0 in her other program. So, Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if I'm reading you, right, you you really didn't have any competition for this award that you were aware of. Right? And now you feel you really do, Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I feel the pressures on like, I felt I tried hard, this whole program and now this new person comes in, and she might want a different me I really need to go above and beyond to make sure that I'm still on track. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I'm paradoxically that's caused you to be more anxious and more stressed and your performing but you're still getting the A's which are working harder to get the A's, Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right. And it's causing me a lot of anxiety with school where it's not as enjoyable for me as it once was. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what would it mean if you couldn't get the award if you didn't with the, what's the name of the new was first name with a new choice choice? Okay, but of choice once award, and you didn't want me? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I guess part of me feels them. Why did I do the program? if, you know, part of me feels if you're not going to be the best why try? if, if she got the award over me, then it's kind of like, why did I work hard this whole time, I could have been slacking this whole time and skated by why did I bust my butt? If it was all for nothing? I don't have anything to show for it. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): its all or nothing if you don't win the award. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, I guess it's not the only thing that matters part of me feels that way sometimes that I have these thoughts that if I don't try my hardest and do and win this award, then why do I try hard the rest of the time, but it negates all the positive things. This that this, you know, kind of the end result if you tried hard the whole race and then you lose, you know, at the end. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right, but you're not really losing a race because you would still graduate? Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You're you're not getting a word, which you would like, and which would be great. Right, and certainly accomplishment. But the reason you came to the program was to get the degree, Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): and even know about the award until probably the second year anyway, that wasn't the reason I entered. But, Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): but it's now it's now taken on some importance for you winning award has been a real goal. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): with the new student choice coming in, I have this increased competition. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And that's causing me anxiety is caused you to work hard for the same grade. All right. So, as we talked before, you have a tendency to be, I mean, this as a compliment a little perfectionistic. Right. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. It is taking too far, It can be it can be not useful. Ever hear the phrase Perfect is the enemy of good. No. Does that make sense what that might mean? Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. this desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing you not even to perform well. Right? Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1):  Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're still getting the A's but it's called the anxiety and you're working hard and Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): now I'm not even I feel when I read, like, I'm stressed with it from reading the thing and memorizing every word that I'm not retaining all the information, it could and it's starting to impact school. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): is there any way that you cannot win the award and still walk away? having accomplished worthy goals? Or does it have to be the award or none of this was worth it? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I mean, it kind of sounds silly when you when you're reflecting it back to me how, you know that I have to read the words I, I think that it makes sense. You know, that wasn't my goal going into it. You know, why does it matter much to me that there's different degrees of success. I think if you've said before that is Not all about the award, I think I would be happy with just, you know, getting the degree and all the stuff that I've learned. And I would feel it was, if I didn't get the award rather, I would feel it was still a worthwhile journey. But in the moment, sometimes it's really upsetting at the thought of not getting the award. But that's a possibility. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Your word validates all the hard work you've done. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, exactly. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And in your mind, losing the award invalidates all the hard work you've done, right? But in reality, there's probably a between ground there might have been a shade of gray, where you're still an excellent student, you still graduate, you don't have an extra plaque hanging on the wall, whatever the word is, right. That's really all you'd be missing. Right? Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): yep Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): With this award have any impact on employment? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't think I am thinking about I don't think of a long term many people would know about it besides me, or if I put it, you know, on a resume or something, but I don't think it would make that much of a difference. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And you didn't know about it when you first came in, and you're already working hard. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): at the beginning, I didn't even know about it. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): in a sense, and of course, we can't do this, for the sense of you could forget about the award. Right? You probably win it. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right, Right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Because you're already doing well. But the thought of this potential failure, away the word that's holding you back, Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right, It makes me it makes me paranoid to make mistakes or to try and take risks or to really, you know, do because I'm worried about judgment, from my teachers, if I'm doing enough. Therapist [DialogueFunction=orq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, there's no there's no tolerance for any type of mistake? Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=-1): Right. Right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): now that with the award out there, you really feel you can't make any type of mistake or you go to, to a catastrophe? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Right, I'm walking on eggshells, and I'm expecting my grades to tank if I if I kind of deviate from that line. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): free for you to feel better about this one way, I guess would be to not help have to not place much value in way. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): It's really hard. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah, you really want that. And it would be great. And that's okay. Right? We talked about the adaptive responses before, right? What are what's your automatic thought you have when you're sitting there and trying to get every assignment and you you're kind of vaguely thinking about not losing or not winning this award was the automatic thought that comes to mind? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): if I'm you If I want when I'm doing the work, Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): yeah, when you're doing your work, and you sense that anxiety come on, as you start maybe vaguely thinking about winning or losing this award, right? it's losing it Really? What's going through your mind that moment? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I guess I'm kind of running through a checklist. Did I do this? Did I do this? Did I do this? Making sure I did everything that was expected of me Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): to ensure that you're gonna get that award? Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. at a higher level, one of your thoughts is, I must win that award. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Does that make sense? I mean, that that's probably somewhere. Is there any type of adaptive response you could apply that moment, that statement, or kind of, well, that's an absolute statement, right? I must win that award. Is there any type of adaptive response you could play at that moment that could counteract that on thought Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): That I must win the award? Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I guess I could say that, you know, this, the award is something local to my university and no one's going to know about it in the grand scheme of things. it won't really impact future employment or what my colleagues think of me. You know, if I, if I don't get the award that they won't think less of me. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you could say, it'd be nice to win the award. But in the end, it's not really gonna make the difference in my life in terms of my career Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): and, and that's a fair, adaptive response, right? You do want to win it, right? Truthfully, and it would be nice to win it right. Who doesn't want to win the award, right? But if you don't, you were still good student. You're still gonna be a good connection and your career still good before. Do you believe in that adaptive response? Do you believe that adaptive response is true? Patient [DialogueFunction=od] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I feel sometimes I do. And then sometimes it's really hard in the heat of the moment to kind of talk myself down from that, that kind of spiral of not doing this assignment, right? I'm not doing well. I'm going to get to be in this class, I'm going to lose this award. I feel it starts. It's hard in the moment to spiral out of that. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): what percentage of the time Do you believe that adaptive response is true? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Maybe half the time, Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): 50% of time? Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): right? depends on what's going on in my stress. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): And the other half, you're not really buying. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0):  Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. what advice Well, let's use choice, right? choices in the same situation, in a sense, in that she's, well, maybe not knowing what she is working toward this award as Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I don't even know she knows about the award. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Let's assume. Let's assume she knows about it. Right? He's in a similar situation. What advice would you give her? She's kind of obsessing about this in the same way that you are. Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Yeah. I think I would tell her that, you know, the rest of the class sees that she's doing well. Her teachers give her positive feedback. all science would point towards that you're doing really and you're being very successful in the program that you're getting positive feedback from them. that all the signs the feedback is telling you you're doing a really good job. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Your advice to her seems positive and uplifting. Mostly, your advice to her is more positive, uplifting what you're telling yourself internally, Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): definitely it is. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): if that advices adequate. I feel It is adequate and appropriate for her. Why isn't it adequate probably for you? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): I don't know sometimes I feel I hold myself to a higher standard than I hold other people to if some a friend of mine Joyce would come and tell me the same situation, you know, I'd be able to give her a whole bunch of, you know, suggestions or some positive feedback, but it's really hard for me sometimes because I hold myself to a higher standard than other people. Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): But you would agree your advice to choice as you frame it to me is useful, right? But you're having trouble applying that to yourself? Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Yes. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Smooth. That's what you need to work on a bit. you can kind of see the logic of all this, but your feelings don't match. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=-1): Correct. Makes sense in my head and I would know what to tell someone else but I don't always believe it. When I say to myself, Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Alright, here's what I want you to do. You familiar with the thought record that I introduced you in the first session where you can outline your situation and your feelings and you've explained all this to me, I want you to complete one thought records. Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0):  Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I know after having set it all might seem doubling the work. But I think it's something changes when you write something down. Okay, I have to face it on paper. And also, it's a good tool to remember exactly what you're thinking. And then work through the adaptive response section and their smiles at the bottom of thought record questions you can ask yourself to help you form that adaptive response. And maybe write out a few different ones. But there's plenty of room on the forum. You see it, right, Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's the largest grid cell is the one on adaptive responses, that the responses don't have to be short. yours wasn't short. There's really good they can they can be long and they can be realistic, like, I'd to win. It would be good to win. But Alice should have to be successful. Patient [DialogueFunction=cr] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0):  Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I thinl the adaptive response kicked out is to the downside of not having success, okay? It doesn't have to be completely positive. Okay, has to be realistic and useful. And, as importantly, you have to believe it. Okay, there's a place on there to note what percentage you believe that you could write that in. Okay, I know we'll look at that from week to week and, you know, as we move closer to your graduation, hopefully it'll bring you some relief for missing anxiety. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0):  Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): that's sounds a good plan? Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0):  Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Thanks.\n",

I can see how he would think I'm depressed. Because, you know, I'm bored. I, you know, I'm not sleeping well, and I'm not eating because what if they poisoned my food?

Two months? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean, yes. I've always been aware that the government you know, is probably up to things that they probably shouldn't be and that they have access and abilities beyond, you know, the normal person. But after I saw the kidnapping, I had proof and it's it's gotten worse because I feel they know that I know. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you felt this way for a while, but seeing what you saw two months ago that made you more short? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes.

It's always been something else. Like, I'm fine. I just, I'm aware of what's going on around me. And I don't think my dad understands that I don't think the places he takes me understands that. Patient [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): what have the people at the places where he has taken, you know, what have they said about your condition? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Um, you know, they, they try to say the same thing that you know, I'm depressed or whatever, but, you know, I know I know the truth and sometimes I have to play along. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): play along with it. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, because, you know, this is what the government wants, they want me to look crazy. there's nothing I can do about it. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You think they want to discredit you? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Because if I if, you know, it's kind of smearing my good name. They see me in and out of different agencies and appearing crazy. You know, obviously a lot of people don't believe the story they choose not to believe where they get paid off. And they write what they write on my file but it's not true. I'm know what's going on. Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Because you know what's going on. That's what's led to all these occurrences. This is This has led to the symptoms. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Yeah, lately Yeah. Like, you know, I haven't been asleep, you know, and, you know, I feel guilty about what's going on. Right. mean that I know and that, you know, I feel it's hard for me to help them, with, you know, cameras everywhere and I came to the grocery store without being watched. And I know they're watching me you know, I I do everything else was too, you know I go to work I do the chores, because I have to make sure they see me going to work chores. Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you see you kind of play along. Patient [DialogueFunction=cd.ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): All right. do you ever have any thoughts related to death or dying or anything that? Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No. Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, I'm worried. No. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): You worried about what? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I mean. I'm worried about the government, you know, destroying My life, you know, but I don't want to die and I don't think they're going to kill me. I think that'd be too easy. And it would be more proof. Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): there'll be more proof that the way you've seen this real Patient [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): correct, because obviously I'm trying to tell people about it. And if I suddenly show up missing, there, people are going to know. I know that they're not going to hurt me, but they could make me look crazy and I'm worried about my life. them worried in my life. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): About that way. Hmm. How about any drug or alcohol? abuse? Right? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No, nothing. I dont to use those things. All right. Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Any medical conditions? Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Has there ever been a time when you felt really very happy, how lotta energy it was very happy for several days. Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Not really. Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That's never happened? Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): No. Therapist [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Have you ever heard or seen things other people can't hear or see. Patient [DialogueFunction=on] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I think that I'm aware of things that people but no Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): who'd been hospitalized before? Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yes. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): But again, it was I tried to initially tell my my dad about some things that I never knew about and he had taken me to the hospital but that was before. Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): So, I would to get him to talk to a counselor today. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): How do you feel about that? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): really necessary today like, Can I come back another day? Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I think it would be helpful for you. We had a counselor talk to you today. Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Well, Patient [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I understand that's what you need to do. I guess that's what the you know, that's what we need to do to get this over with. That's fine. Therapist [DialogueFunction=gc] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): You can. you can be with that. Patient [DialogueFunction=ack] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): I can play along, Therapist [DialogueFunction=crq] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): you can play along. Therapist [DialogueFunction=cd] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Sure. I want to thank you for answering these questions. I know this is a tough experience for you have a tough time with everything that's going on that you've described. it's, it's been helpful for you to answer these questions for me. And I need a couple minutes and I'll get you over to see a counselor and we'll kind of go from there. Patient [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, Therapist [DialogueFunction=gt] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): thanks, Sherry.\n",
      "Output: The patient says that their dad is worried because they are depressed. The patient has called police at times because they believe government kidnaps girls in their area for sex trafficking and prostitution. The patient once complained about a girl gone missing for which the police assured everything is okay. The patient believes police lied and they are in on it. The patient is paranoid about government monitoring everything with cameras. The patient claims that they are just scared and not depressed. The patient has been feeling this for a few months but after they saw the kidnapping, the patient feels they have proof. The patient is also scared that the government knows they know. The patient has been treated before for depression but the patient didn't believe it was depression even before. The patient is worried about government's constant surveillance on them. They do not have thougts related to death. They are not afraid that government might kill them but scared that they might be made to look crazy. The patient has not used drug or alcohol, no medical conditions, not been very happy for several days. The patient has been hospitalized before for saying things to dad that they don't know. The therapist requested to set up with a counselor to talk with the patient and their dad.\n",

      "Dialogue 1: <PrimaryTopic: anxiety> <SecondaryTopic: hygiene-dog> <GlobalEmotion: 0.00> Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel my stats were much higher than the end. I guess that was what we talked about the Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed. Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Did that change by yesterday? Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. you're doing well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today we planned, right. Okay. this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): right. the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. did you write the story? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would say a 70. Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. you have that for homework. Okay. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): let me now your stress level Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 90 Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you're doing great, keep going. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I keep going. I walk the dog, come back home, and I leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. I can't stop thinking about washing. I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep. The next morning I wake up, and I already feel sick. I know I'm sick. I'm shivering and I'm, I feel I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated. I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick. And I feel really, really sick. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, great job. What's your level now? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 80. Okay. Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All right. keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you stay with that image as much as you can. you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. you go toward the leash, and it makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel it's running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is powerful, strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 80 Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay, you take it back and you do it again. Okay. Good job. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, so, I'm home. The dog starts barking\n",

      "Dialogue 1: <PrimaryTopic: anxiety> <SecondaryTopic: hygiene-dog> <GlobalEmotion: 0.00> Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): It got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel my stats were much higher than the end. I guess that was what we talked about the Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed. Therapist [DialogueFunction=yq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Right. Did that change by yesterday? Patient [DialogueFunction=op] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Yeah. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. you're doing well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today we planned, right. Okay. this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): right. the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. did you write the story? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): I would say a 70. Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. you have that for homework. Okay. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): let me now your stress level Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 90 Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=routine) (Emotion=0): Okay, you're doing great, keep going. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I keep going. I walk the dog, come back home, and I leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. I can't stop thinking about washing. I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep. The next morning I wake up, and I already feel sick. I know I'm sick. I'm shivering and I'm, I feel I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated. I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick. And I feel really, really sick. Therapist [DialogueFunction=irq] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): Okay, great job. What's your level now? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 80. Okay. Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=story) (Emotion=0): All right. keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you stay with that image as much as you can. you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. you go toward the leash, and it makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel it's running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is powerful, strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now? Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=symp/reasoning) (Emotion=0): 80 Therapist [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay. Okay, you take it back and you do it again. Okay. Good job. Patient [DialogueFunction=id] (Sub_topic=inactive) (Emotion=0): Okay, so, I'm home. The dog starts barking\n",
